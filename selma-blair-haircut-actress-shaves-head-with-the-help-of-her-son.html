Back to my roots,” the actress captioned the photo. “#zen barber who still says butthole whenever given an opportunity. I love him.”</p><p>In the picture, the star is wearing a gray t-shirt, as she turns her head to the side so Arthur can get a better angle to work his magic.</p><p>People were loving the moment between the two, and commended the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruel Intentions</a>&nbsp;star. “You look amazing. How special for him to do that haircut for you. Definitely a memory for him,” one fan said. Another added, “You’re such an amazing mom. Some days I just want to give up and throw the towel in with my brain disorder making me so tired and exhausted, but then I see you and it always inspires me to keep going and put a smile on my sons face despite how I’m feeling. You give me hope.”</p><p>Selma shares the young boy with her ex-boyfriend Jason Bleick — the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pair split</a> after two years of dating. However, it seems like Arthur is doing well, as he spends a ton of time with his mother. The&nbsp;Hellboy costar shares plenty of photos featuring her son, and is quite open about their bond.</p><p>Selma has also been open about her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple sclerosis diagnosis</a>, which she revealed in October 2018.<br>“After the MRI, I said, ‘I have something called multiple sclerosis,’ and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">[Arthur] almost cried</a> and said, ‘Will it kill you?'” the brunette beauty recalled to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Robin Roberts</strong></a> on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Morning America</a> on February 26.</p><p>“And I said, ‘No. I mean, we never know what kills us, Arthur. But this is not the doctor telling me I’m dying,'” she said of their conversation. “And he was like, ‘Oh. Okay!'”</p><p>So great seeing how close Selma and Arthur are!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46snKWlkWKvra3Iq2ShmZmnsLbAjJqaraqVqMBuv8earZ6rXZ2yorCMsKCtoF2ptaZ5x56jqWWfm3qpsdFmqqimXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
