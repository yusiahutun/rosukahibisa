It claimed to have cooperated with several local supermarkets and shopping malls. So, if you wanted to charge your phone, you would use the app to find a charging station or power bank device. Then, you would have to hire a power bank to charge your phone.</p><p class=align-left>In return, the entity or individual renting out their resources would gain the income you pay. Unfortunately, while the concept was straightforward, its implementation was not well executed, especially in <a href=# rel=noopener>Kenya</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs7gk29dif85d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is the Solar Factory app a scam or legit?

First, it used referrals whereby a user would refer a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">paying individual</a> to the app. If the individual makes a payment, the user receives a small commission.

It also has a free option for users who want to make money through referrals or completing tasks. Also, the PB Power app allows users to deposit large amounts, including Ksh 100,000, Ksh 150,000, Ksh 200,000, and Ksh 300,000.</p><h2>How much money do users make from PB Power bank?</h2><p class=align-left>The amount of money a user makes from PB Power bank depends on their deposit amount. For example, users who do not deposit any amount make a commission of Ksh 10 after completing simple tasks. However, you cannot withdraw the money until you invest.

In Kenya, it was a scam that made many people lose thousands of their money. Initially, users could deposit and withdraw money using their mobile phones, particularly Safaricom’s M-PESA, without issues.</p><p class=align-left>Issues emerged with both deposits and withdrawals. Besides, the app built the entire concept around a pyramid scheme. However, here is why it is a big scam:</p><h3>Promise to make money through referrals</h3><p class=align-left>A pyramid scheme allows unscrupulous individuals or entities to make money by recruiting as many investors as possible. So, the app allowed users to invite as many other users as possible. Then, after inviting new users, one only gets paid after the new users deposit into the app. That was the first glance of a system about to con people.</p><h3>Users could not withdraw commissions</h3><p class=align-left>Even after inviting paying users and making a commission, the PB Power Bank app scam prevented them from withdrawing their commissions. A person could only withdraw after making a deposit or investing in a Power Bank product.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a88e15a3e53bcda2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to open a Jiji account and start selling online</span></p></a><h3>Unreasonable interest rates</h3><p class=align-left>The daily income offered by the PB Power Bank app was outrageous. No entity worldwide provides a 6% interest rate daily. In Kenya, most financial institutions offer interest rates of about 8% on customer deposits. And when you factor in inflation, the interest rate goes down drastically.</p><p class=align-left>The considerable interest rate means PB Power Bank was not making any money from user deposits. And even if the app was legit and offered such huge returns, it was bound to fail because PB Bank depended on user deposits to make profits.</p><h3>Delays in withdrawals</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/274be9c6d330b783.jpeg><p class=align-left>For initial Kenyan users who could withdraw, it took around four or more hours to have their money in their <a href=#>mobile phones</a>. That was suspicious because M-PESA transactions happen almost instantly.</p><h2>How people lost their money</h2><p class=align-left>After depositing money, many Kenyans could see that they had enough cash in their PB Power Bank accounts. However, trouble started when they went to their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">accounts to withdraw</a> their money. Nobody could withdraw their cash. Upon inquiry from PB Power Bank, the app blamed the M-PESA payment company for suspending its collection and payment <a href=#>business</a> without proper reason.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ecc596918b26b79f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Berry loan app - download and installation</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As a result, the app could no longer continue its business operations, and customers could not complete payments, including transfers. Many users tried to inquire from <a href=#>Safaricom</a> whether it had an issue with PB Power Bank.</p><p class=align-left>Safaricom had nothing to do with the company’s mishap. Since then, nobody in Kenya has used the PB Power Bank app. Instead, the app rebranded to Charge Anytime and targeted Ugandans in early 2022. However, Ugandans also soon found out that the app was a scam.</p><p class=align-left>The PB Power Bank app came to the Kenyan market to help users earn money online. One could deposit as little as Ksh 800 to as much as Ksh 300,000 and earn an interest rate between 6% and 9% daily. But after several months of taking user deposits, the app became a scam. It also rebranded to Charge Anytime to target Ugandans who later got scammed by the same scheme.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ed6982b728d68aec.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=#><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How does M-Kopa work?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke published an article about <a href=#>online jobs in Kenya</a> that pay through M-Pesa in 2022. One of the most popular trends in today's society is online work. Unlike conventional jobs, working online eliminates the need for physical employer-employee interaction, resulting in numerous advantages for both parties.</p><p class=align-left>For Kenyans, there are wide-ranging online jobs that pay via M-Pesa, making the entire process quite convenient in terms of payments. Receiving your payments via M-Pesa eliminates the delays and inconveniences associated with some other money transfer options. Online paying jobs include freelance writing, virtual assistant, flipping website and others.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCywJyrrGWcnrOmtMCcoqxnZGyFdoKVZqCsZaCXerG71p6pZpqRo7hurc%2BpZJplo5iurnnDnquaoZyoerOx1Z6YpZ2UZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
