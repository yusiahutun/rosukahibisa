It was commissioned by a private collector and is not for sale.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Biu Kee Mahjong is operated by Cheung Shun-king, one of the few remaining artisan mahjong tile carvers left in Hong Kong. The store is the third Hong Kong building Smith has created in miniature, after his Temple Street shophouse that went viral and a tong lau building on Des Voeux Road West in Sheung Wan.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As with most of the other buildings around the world he has recreated in miniature, Smith has never seen Biu Kee Mahjong in person – he works with Google Street View and photos sent in by his Instagram followers around the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/03/08/5da860cb-831c-4705-a42f-6f1cb11dca50_e0ffc51e.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/03/08/6947140f-bb07-45be-aded-2a3072cde551_c6f44403.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/03/08/3995e5b0-2977-4c27-86a5-5b285a8afde6_808dd032.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A private collector based in the UK contacted me in March last year looking for a miniature based on a small shop,” Smith told the Post. “After some research and finding out that this was one of the last shops that hand-carved mahjong tiles, I decided that [Biu Kee Mahjong] would be the basis of the miniature.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Smith, who lives in the South Australian capital of Adelaide, rose to fame internationally when images of his Temple Street building – complete with peeling paint, posters, graffiti, laundry on poles and a shrine – became a viral sensation in 2017.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Joshua Smith, viral Hong Kong miniatures artist, to make first visit</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like his other miniatures, the 1:20 scale replica&nbsp;was made using wood, cardboard, plastic card, chalk, spray paint, wire and modelling plastic. The Temple Street building was completed and exhibited in New York in 2017, and later sold to a private collector in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While he has created miniatures of buildings in cities as far afield as Kaohsiung in Taiwan and New York, Smith said at the time that Hong Kong had always been the city he most wanted to visit – he first developed a love of the city and its dilapidated buildings through watching the city’s kung fu films as a youngster.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/03/09/75a79512-02ef-421e-b21e-1ee0fc562ea1_f65f0f57.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/03/08/70fd3b9c-d4c8-4113-8e14-83e5fc8bcc5f_4c0589f6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Smith is a self-taught stencil artist and started building miniatures in 2015 after closing an art gallery he had been running in Adelaide. He has created dozens of buildings from cities such as New York, San Francisco and Melbourne, and has exhibited his works at galleries and art fairs in London, Paris, Berlin, San Francisco, New York, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Sydney and Melbourne.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The artist says he is inspired by urban decay, and explains that the characteristic grime and wear and tear that add such realism to his work is achieved by applying layers of paint and chalk.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I notice all the little details – the cigarette butts and the newspapers on the ground – and if I can make people see the beauty in decay, then my job is done.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/03/08/3da73730-46ff-4e77-8c81-8cf3d198e6bb_98951a30.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Smith said he planned on making more Hong Kong-based miniatures this year, including a model of the Lai Kwong electrical store in Sham Shui Po. “The dream would be to build something like the Kowloon Walled City. Maybe when I retire,” Smith said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHR9kW1sbG1foq6pts6nnmarmKS9brnOnZylpJWZerTAwKCenqqZo7RusMStmKKkXZa%2FtbXSrWSsoZedwW7BzaycnqY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
