How? Simply warm them up to enjoy as a solo treat or to dip into a cold glass of milk. Reheating cookies so they taste like they’re freshly baked isn’t tricky at all. With the help of a few baker’s tricks, your leftover cookies can become soft and chewy again after a quick stint in the microwave or oven. Plus, we’ve got a clever tip for storing cookies that makes heating them up later a breeze. Here’s how to reheat cookies for times when you and your loved ones can’t devour the entire batch in one sitting!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The best types of cookies to reheat</h2><p>Before we get into proper reheating methods, let’s first talk about the types of cookies that work well for reheating. Chewy cookies such as <a href=#>chocolate chip</a>, oatmeal raisin, peanut butter and snickerdoodles are excellent choices since they’re moist and soften even more when reheated correctly. In contrast, crisp cookies like biscotti and shortbread have a drier texture, making them less ideal for reheating.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Can you reheat cookies with frosting?</h2><p>If your cookies have icing or frosting on top, they’re fine to reheat. Just be sure to use low temperatures and keep an eye on them so the topping doesn’t melt off or burn.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>#1 step to do before reheating cookies&nbsp;</h2><p>You can prevent your cookies from drying into bricks by storing them correctly, thus making it easier to reheat them. One way to retain moisture in cookies is to <a href=#>store them in an airtight container with a piece of white bread</a>. In addition to the container (which blocks out air), the moisture from the bread stops the treats from hardening quickly. While the cookies can last around <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2 to 3 weeks</a> stored at room temperature, regularly replace the bread slice once it turns stale. Using these tips, you’ll be able to enjoy those tasty morsels again — whether you’re warming them up in the microwave or oven!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>For a quick treat: how to reheat cookies in the microwave</h2><p>The speedier way to reheat cookies is to pop them in the microwave. “This [method] can revive their chewiness. But be cautious not to overheat, as microwaves can make cookies harden quickly,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Allyson Brigham, MS, RDN</a>, founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sweetitian</a>. So, you’ll need to add moisture to your cookies to prevent them from turning into hockey pucks. Below, Brigham shares four easy steps for reheating cookies in the microwave in seconds.</p><li>Soak a paper towel with water and then squeeze it to remove as much liquid as possible.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrap 1 to 2 cookies with the damp paper towel, or place the paper towel over a plate of cookies.</li><li>Microwave your cookies for 10 to 15 seconds.&nbsp;</li><li>Remove the paper towel and enjoy your fresh, steaming cookies.<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you don’t have any paper towels handy, you can always microwave your cookies with a glass of water. This will create a source of moisture to rehydrate your cookies.&nbsp;</p></li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>For an extra chewy treat: how to reheat cookies in the oven</h2><p>Reheating cookies in the oven is the better option for evenly warming the inside and outside of the treat. “When you reheat in the oven, the cookie can retain the nice and chewy texture with a crispy exterior,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiffany Lewis</a>, chief cookie officer at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cookies with Tiffany</a>. Additionally, this method allows you to heat up multiple cookies at a time. Just be sure to monitor the treats as they’re gently baking to avoid burning. Here’s how to reheat cookies in the oven using three simple steps from Lewis.</p><li>Preheat oven to 300°F.</li><li>Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with foil or parchment paper.</li><li>Once the oven is heated, place the tray on the middle rack and allow the cookies to warm up for 4 to 6 minutes, or until warm.</li><li>Remove your cookies from the oven and enjoy them right away.</li><p>Now that you know the two best ways to reheat cookies, try them out on some of these easy recipes for <a href=#>Christmas cookies with few ingredients</a>!</p><p><strong>Keep reading for more seasonal dessert recipes!</strong></p><p><a href=#>Christmas Brownies That’ll Make Your Holidays Even Sweeter — 10 Easy Recipes</a></p><p><a href=#>7 Christmas Tree Cookie Recipes to Sweeten Your Holidays — So Easy and Festive!</a></p><p><a href=#>Christmas Cupcakes to Make Your Holidays Merry and Bright — 10 Easy Recipes</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonainlGK%2Fpq%2FIqZysZ5ikxG7AzmapnqCVlsFur86ooqKdow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
