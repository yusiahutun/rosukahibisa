Now, Windows has finally entered the space age with its own astronomy-themed wallpapers. Read on to learn how to install live wallpapers on your Windows PC and get a glimpse of the universe every time you log in.</p><h2 id=how-to-install-a-live-wallpaper>How to Install a Live Wallpaper</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lively-Wallpaper-Website-Screenshot.jpg><p>Windows does not support setting a live wallpaper natively. That’s why you have to download a standalone app. One such app is Lively Wallpaper—a free and open-source software that lets you set up an animated desktop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was first released on GitHub by Dani John in 2019. Since then, he has continuously updated and released new versions of the app. You can download and install it from the Microsoft Store. However, the latest version is typically available first on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lively Wallpaper</a> website.</p><p>After downloading the app, open it and start that installation process. Ensure that you have the <strong>Start with Windows</strong> toggle switched to <strong>On</strong>. If you’re running a basic or old computer, you can choose <strong>Lite </strong>under the <strong>User Interface</strong> options to make it easier for your system.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lively-Wallpaper-Setup-Start-with-Windows.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lively-Wallpaper-Setup-User-Interface.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lively-Wallpaper-Setup-Taskbar-Theme.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>The <strong>Taskbar Theme</strong> dropdown list lets you choose how you want your Taskbar to appear. You can preview the changes you make with every selection. You can also change these later in the app’s settings menu.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the setup process, you need to go to the <strong>System Tray</strong>, <strong>right-click</strong> on the <strong>Lively Icon</strong>, then choose <strong>Open Lively</strong> to complete the install.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lively Wallpaper</a> (free)</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Set Live Wallpapers & Animated Desktop Backgrounds in Windows 10</a></span></p><h2 id=where-to-find-live-wallpapers>Where to Find Live Wallpapers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lively-Setup-Screen-06-1.jpg><p>Congratulations! You can now have live desktop backgrounds on your computer! There are twelve stock live wallpapers immediately available. However, none of them are space-themed. To fix that, here are a few places where you can get live space backgrounds.</p><h3 id=visualdon>1. Visualdon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Visualdon-website.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Visualdon</a> is a visual artist and educator with a UK-based website. They create video loops and visuals that you can use as an active wallpaper. Some of their creations, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Interstellar</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The World’s Last Night</a>, are excellent space-themed live wallpapers. And if you want something a bit more retro, you can also check out the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Apparent Retrograde Motion</a> video.</p><p>These files are available to download for free for personal use. And if you want to have more options, you can also visit the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Visualdon shop</a> and see other creations like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Space Drive</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Dreams</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wormhole</a>.</p><h3 id=desktop-hut>2. Desktop Hut</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Desktop-Hut-website.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Desktop Hut</a> is another good source of space-themed live wallpapers. Desktop Hut has a vast compilation of live wallpapers, and you can even find some of them available at 4K resolution. Best of all, they’re free!</p><p>You can find subtle designs like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Space Planet and Stars</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Space Blackhole</a>. They also have more dynamic wallpapers like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spaceman Walking</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rainbow Nebula</a>.</p><p>There is one catch when you access this page, though. Because they’re offering their downloads for free, they have a lot of ads on their pages. So the website may get annoying to browse sometimes, especially with pop-up ads. But it’s a good trade-off for the high-quality wallpapers you can get.</p><h3 id=orbit-ndash-a-journey-around-earth>3. ORBIT – a Journey Around Earth</h3><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You could also find amazing videos on YouTube that you could use as a live wallpaper. One good example is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ORBIT</a>, a video created by Seán Doran. It’s a one-and-a-half-hour showcase of our planet, recorded in 4K from NASA’s archives.</p><p>Although the video starts at the 1:26 mark, the wait is absolutely worth it. You will enjoy breathtaking views of our planet from space. It also offers a beautiful soundtrack, so you can enjoy calming music when you’re focused on your desktop.</p><h3 id=nocturne---earth-at-night>4. Nocturne - Earth at Night</h3><p>If you want to see the Earth’s surface at night, then you should check out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nocturne</a>. This is another work by Seán Doran, the same creator who made Orbit. The video starts at the 1:12 mark this time and lasts a little over 47 minutes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This time, you’ll be mesmerized by the intricate lights our roads and cities have at night. You’ll get to see a view of the majestic northern lights later on in the video. Put this up as your live wallpaper if you want to see what the Earth looks like at night from the International Space Station.</p><h3 id=stars-in-the-universe>5. STARS in the Universe</h3><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">STARS in the Universe</a> YouTube video is another example of a simple but elegant live wallpaper. Said G. created this video, where it seems you’re traveling in deep space, with several stars passing by. You could also see the faint outline of a galaxy in the distance as you fly through the Universe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=floating-in-space>6. Floating in Space</h3><p>If you want a space-themed live wallpaper that’s a bit on the trippy side, you can try this Infinite Loop YouTube video called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Floating in Space</a>. It’s a video of an astronaut seemingly floating on an ocean in space.</p><p>The reflections of the stars on the water’s surface, as well as on the spaceman’s visor, make you feel as if you’re floating with him. Plus, the cosmic background music completes the feel for an out-of-this-world desktop experience.</p><h3 id=ambient-space-music>7. Ambient Space Music</h3><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is another YouTube video called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ambient Space Music</a> that's another great choice. The creator, Epic Ambience, combines serene tones with beautiful imagery for a relaxing experience. This particular video is an excellent rendering of our solar system. As such, if you want all of our solar system's planets on your desktop, you should definitely check this one out.</p><h2 id=how-to-load-your-chosen-wallpaper>How to Load Your Chosen Wallpaper</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Adding-YouTube-videos-as-a-Live-Wallpaper-on-Lively-Wallpaper.jpg><p>Now that you’ve found a live wallpaper you like, you now need to load it to the Lively Wallpaper app. There are two ways of doing that. The first is by downloading the video file and then dragging and dropping it to the app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The second way is to copy the YouTube video link, go to the <strong>Add Wallpaper</strong> tab on <strong>Lively Wallpaper</strong>, and paste it into the <strong>Enter URL</strong> box. You then need to click the <strong>right arrow</strong> to apply the YouTube video as your live wallpaper.</p><p>While both the first and second ways of loading a live wallpaper works, it’s better to download your chosen live wallpaper video on your computer first. That way, even if you’re not online, the app can load your selected background.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Download Any Video From the Internet</a></span></p><h2 id=enhance-your-desktop-experience>Enhance Your Desktop Experience</h2><p>If you’re a fan of outer and interstellar space travel, then what better way is there than to show it off as your desktop background? And you could go beyond the usual by simply using a static image through these live wallpapers.</p><p>However, do take note that a live wallpaper may take up some system resources. If you have a high-end computer with lots of RAM and storage, then, by all means, you should install live wallpaper. But if you’re running a basic or old PC, then maybe consider sticking to a <a href=#>new static image instead</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuoqaUpMS0edKpmJydXam1prnEnWSwmZyhvaK8xKuqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
