Nestled between the Irish Sea and the Lake District peninsula, the Cumbrian town is classed as one of the most deprived in England by the Office of National Statistics."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I call it death row because so many of the shops are shut and boarded up. We avoid it.</p><p>“There’s nothing else for kids to do around here but vandalise. It’s hard because there’s nowhere to go shopping. Maybe Manchester if you can afford it, but most can’t.”</p><p>James, who has been out of work since the pandemic, and partner Zoe Laurence, who works in Tesco, are new parents, and admit they're worried about how they'll make ends meet as the cost of living rises.&nbsp;</p><p>She says: “I can’t really plan because things change so quickly. It’s so hard to keep up with everything, so we just take it day by day and manage as best we can.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/db115c02-f2c9-474d-be8a-c6612602f01b.jpg><p>Walking through the town there's a hopeful busker singing in front of a smashed-up shop which used to house Thorntons.</p><p>Poundland worker Becca says Barrow is the "worst place" she's ever worked - and she's "worked in some grim places".&nbsp;</p><p>She says: “Past a certain point everything is boarded up and the windows are smashed.&nbsp;</p><p>“Even Poundland, which isn’t empty, has been targeted by vandals and has had signs and windows put through that need to be repaired.&nbsp;</p><p>“Nothing is being done to make the town look less run down.

In north Cumbria we had a county lines group receive jail sentences totalling nearly 90 years.</p><p>"But one of our issues is the speed at which people set up new lines. It's like these whack-a-mole games at Blackpool - as soon as we hit one, there are others popping up.”</p><p>Strolling through residential streets there are more boarded-up buildings, piles of rubbish on the streets and a pocket of fly-tipped furniture.</p><p>Amy, from Manchester, moved here as her partner has a job at BAE, but "didn't expect things to be so bad".</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>"Obviously, I can get a three-bed house here for the price of a flat in Manchester," she says.</p><p>"But there's nowhere for anyone to go.
