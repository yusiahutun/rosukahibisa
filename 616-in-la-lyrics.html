After the surprise drop of “Euphoria” on April 30, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick Lamar’s “6:16 In LA” lyrics</a> are a direct, blistering attack on Drake and it seems things are really heating up between the two.</p><p>In the world of hip-hop, friendly competition, and the occasional back-and-forth banter in lyrics are not uncommon, but things between Drake and the Pulitzer-winning Kendrick have been boiling over as of late.</p><p>On April 19, 2024, Drake released “Push Ups”&nbsp;as his response to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Kendrick Lamar’s verse</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;Metro Boomin&nbsp;and&nbsp;Future’s “Like That.” The verse was a jab at J. Cole’s “First Person Shooter,” in which he referred to himself, Drake, and Kendrick as “the big three.” Drake fired at Kendrick again with “Taylor Made Freestyle”.</p><p>On April 30, Kendrick issued a rebuttal with “Euphoria”; a striking 6-minute takedown of Drake: “A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now / You’rе not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accеpted.”</p><p>Kendrick lobbed another music grenade at Drake on May 3, 2024. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick Lamar’s “6:16 in LA” lyrics</a> are scathing attacks on the Canadian-born rapper. The song title seems to reference a song format Drake is known for popularizing, including “6PM in New York” from If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late to “8am in Charlotte” from <a href=#>his recent album, For All the Dogs</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=kendrick-lamar-s-6-16-in-la-lyrics-meaning>Kendrick Lamar’s “6:16 in LA” lyrics meaning</h2><p>We’ve picked them apart so you don’t have to.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.5><h2>Intro</h2><p>Uh (Uh)<br>Uh (Uh)<br>Uh, yeah (Uh)<br>It’s survival, survival<br>I think somebody lying<br>Smell somebody lying<br>I don’t see no fire</p><ul><li>Kendrick opens the song with accusations that “somebody lying” to pull the first punch against Drake.</li><li>He talks about survival, which could be interpreted as “survival of the fittest” and the idea that the stronger rapper will ultimately come out on top. Pretty self-explanatory.</li></ul></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Off-white Sunseeker at the marina</h2><p>Fuck a Phantom, I like to buy yachts when I get the fever<br>Wine cooler spill on my white t-shirt, the sightseer<br>Trifecta, money, morals, and culture, that’s my leisure<br>My visa, passport tatted, I show up in Ibiza<br>Lucalis dwellings in Brooklyn just to book me some pizza<br>Who could reach us? Only God could teleport this type of freedom<br>God, ah</p><ul><li>Kendrick opens with a reference to Drake’s Mansory Rolls-Royce&nbsp;Phantom luxury car. Kendrick would rather buy boats and travel the world, it seems.</li><li>It could be a reference to Rick Ross’ “luxury rap” style of music. Ross entered the beef between Kendrick and Drake with “Champagne Moments” and he’s also a founder of the rap label Maybach Music Group.</li></ul></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>My God, my confession is yours, but</h2><p>Who am I if I don’t go to war?<br>There’s opportunity when livin’ with loss<br>I discover myself when I fall short<br>Raise my hands to a fallen sky, I fantasize<br>Me jumpin’ planets immortalized, I correspond<br>Three angels watchin’ me all the time<br>Put my children to sleep with a prayer, then close my eyes, definition of peace</p><ul><li>Kendrick is making it clear that he’s not going to take Drake’s disses lying down, declaring they must “go to war”.</li><li>6:16 could be a reference to a few verses in the Bible, and there are religious connotations with angels, prayer, and raising one’s hands to the sky in this part of the rap.</li><li>Proverbs 6:16 – 6:19, Ephesians 6:16, and Jeremiah 6:16 all make references to qualities God hates: pride, lies, and false witness.</li></ul></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Tell me who gon' stop me? I come from love</h2><p>Estelle cover my heart, then open me up<br>Remember when picked up a pen, lyrics that I can trust<br>Timid soul, stare in the mirror, askin’ where I was from<br>Often, I know this type of power is gon’ cost<br>But I live in circadian rhythms of a shooting star<br>The mannerisms of Raphael, I can heal and give you art<br>But the industry’s cooked as I pick the carcass apart</p><ul><li>Here, Kendrick is comparing himself to the great masters of art, e.g. Raphael, who was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance. Raphael’s work was admired for its refinement and often represented an ideal of perfection.</li></ul></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Yeah, somebody's lyin', I can see the vibes on Ak</h2><p>Even he lookin’ compromised, let’s peel the layers back<br>Ain’t no brownie points for beating your chest, harassin’ Ant<br>Fuckin’ with good people make good people go to bat<br>Conspiracies about Cash, dog?

Let’s see<br>Have you ever thought that OVO is workin’ for me?<br>Fake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person<br>Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it<br>Can’t toosie slide up outta this one, it’s just gon’ resurface<br>Every dog gotta have his day, now live in your purpose</p><ul><li>“Have you ever thought that OVO is workin’ for me?” suggests that Drake’s record label, OVO Sound, is secretly loyal to Kendrick with the words “everyone inside your team is whispering you deserve it”. Harsh.</li></ul></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>It was fun until you started to put money in the streets</h2><p>Then lost money ’cause they came back with no receipts<br>I’m sorry that I live a boring life, I love peace<br>But war-ready if the world is ready to see you bleed<br>The Elohim, KTW<br>Know you can’t sleep, these images trouble you<br>Know the wires in your circle should puzzle you<br>If you were street-smart, then you woulda caught that your entourage is only to hustle you</p><ul><li>Kendrick is taking a direct shot at Drake here, suggesting the Canadian rapper has been unsuccessful in digging up dirt on Kendrick.</li><li>He’s also suggesting that there could be a rat amid his team.</li></ul></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>A hundred n—s that you got on salary</h2><p>And twenty of ’em want you as a casualty<br>And one of them is actually next to you<br>And two of them is practically tired of your lifestyle<br>Just don’t got the audacity to tell you<br>But let me tell you some game ’cause I can see you, my lil’ homie<br>You playin’ dirty with propaganda, it blow up on ya</p><ul><li>Again, Kendrick is suggesting there is an information leak within Drake’s team, a reference to what Pusha T said about Drake’s Noah “40” Shebib during their feud. In <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>episode #188 of&nbsp;The Joe Budden Podcast</a>, T said: “Now, I never told nobody [where the information came from]. I never said that to anybody. And I never put that out there. Because, the way I see it, there was so much power in silence.“</li></ul></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>You're playin' nerdy with Zack Bia and Twitter bots</h2><p>But your reality can’t hide behind wifi<br>Your lil’ memes is losin’ steam, they figured you out<br>The forced opinions is not convincin’, y’all need a new route<br>It’s time that you look around on who’s around you<br>Before you figure that you’re not alone, ask what Mike would do</p><ul><li>Kendrick concludes by accusing Drake of hiding behind the internet, conspiring with friend Zack Bia to “play dirty” with Twitter bots.</li><li>The last line in “6:16 in LA” is a reference to Michael Jackson (“Mike”), whom Drake has frequently compared himself to.</li></ul></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfa353ecinZKWZXaHGs7XCrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
