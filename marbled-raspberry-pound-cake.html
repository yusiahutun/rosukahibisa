Strangers on the street often ask us about her hair, and I get it, I do. She’s small, it is big, and also red and with spiral curls going in every direction and there are three other members of our family and none of us have spiral curls or red hair. This isn’t the only way she’s already her own fierce little person. I was definitely not into dolls or dresses growing up, so I watch with awe as she plays for hours with her very pink baby doll, the doll’s stroller, the doll’s purse, the doll’s crib and high chair; when she comes home after being out all day, she likes to sit quietly with her baby on her lap <a href=#>on the sofa</a> for a while to catch up and it is, objectively (I am known for my objectivity when talking about my kids), one of the cutest things I’ve ever seen.</p><p><span id=more-36647></span><br><a href=# title="what you'll need"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm1.staticflickr.com/942/42925323005_e9f2b74714_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="what you'll need" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="fork-crushed raspberries"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm1.staticflickr.com/939/43112188134_006c19b92d_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="fork-crushed raspberries" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="blend to make smooth"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1834/42925322935_e5f8dcd46b_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="blend to make smooth" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="strain out the seeds, if you wish"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1817/43112187934_a31a70d08d_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="strain out the seeds, if you wish" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>So when asked what kind of birthday cake she wanted, she said “PINK!” And I said, “But what flavor?” “Pink.” And also, “Not brown, Yacob likes brown.” (<a href=#>This is true</a>.) And I thought about making the <a href=#>pink lady cake</a> but we ended up not having a big party that required so much cake, just bringing cupcakes to camp* and then going out to dinner with family. Instead, I went in a simpler direction, loosely inspired by a marbled pink and white cake we saw in the pastry case at Starbucks (but didn’t try so no idea how the taste lines up), a few weeks before. Adding a spoonful of raspberry puree into the glaze turning it ferociously pink, much to her glee, and stretching it into this <a href=#>doughnut-shaped pan</a> I bought earlier this summer on a whim made it look like a giant pink emoji of a doughnut, an unequivocal hit with three year-olds, eight year-olds, and everyone who saw the cake go by at the restaurant. [I resisted the urge to say “And the color is all natural! And that’s not plasticky fondant!” — for once — but it was hard.]</p><p><a href=# title="a little lemon zest"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm1.staticflickr.com/858/42925322825_23f611e39c_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="a little lemon zest" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="making the cake"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1832/43112187764_4958b379c8_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="making the cake" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="white batter"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1835/42925322685_71491a973a_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="white batter" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="pink batter"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm1.staticflickr.com/936/43112187714_25954ac140_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="pink batter" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="dollop the two batters"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1794/28892842397_85f1a41f3f_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="dollop the two batters" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="rap on the counter to expel air bubbles"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1793/43112187514_bc723bbcd1_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="rap on the counter to expel air bubbles" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="marbled raspberry cake, baked"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1798/43112187094_b39aa29ca7_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="marbled raspberry cake, baked" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="marbled raspberry pound cake"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1834/28892840627_175408b49e_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="marbled raspberry pound cake" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title=glazing><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm1.staticflickr.com/862/28892841407_764da65ac9_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt=glazing data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="marbled raspberry doughnut cake"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm1.staticflickr.com/853/28892841167_20a0845f9f_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="marbled raspberry doughnut cake" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Of course, you do not need a cutesy cake pan to make this. You can make it as a single loaf or double it in a traditional tube or bundt. You also don’t need much time; I made this entire cake in under two hours and it goes even faster if you don’t have to cool it so the glaze stays in place. As a birthday cake after a big dinner, it was exactly right — not too heavy or sweet, but still cute as a <a href=#>button</a>. It would be great for brunch or lunch this weekend or, you know, now.

To make it in the <a href=#>doughnut-looking pan</a> I show, you’ll want to use 150% of the recipe (it bakes in 38 to 40 minutes). To make a bundt or tube cake, you’ll want to double the recipe (it will take anywhere from 45 to 60 minutes, as shapes range a lot). For the doughnut or bundt cake, I double the glaze. For the raspberries, fork-mashing is easier, but if you’re bothered by seeds or want the smooth appearance you see in the top photo, you’ll want to blend the berries and sieve out the seeds. For the glaze, you could make it with a spoonful of raspberry puree (for this, you’ll definitely want a seedless puree), you could make it with lemon juice, or a mix of both. Or you can skip it for a less sweet cake; it’s perfectly lovely with just a dusting of powdered sugar to finish. For a little more lemon flavor, you can squeeze that half lemon you use for zest and measure the juice (it should be 1 to 2 tablespoons), then use that much less sour cream in the white portion of the cake, adding them at the same time. Finally, a little shopping note: Around here, raspberries come from the grocery store in 6-ounce clamshells, which neatly provides the 1 cup (5 ounces) you’ll need for the pink portion of the cake and the last few you’ll need for a pink glaze.<ul><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>Butter or cooking spray to coat pan</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>Finely grated zest from half a lemon</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 cup (115 grams) unsalted butter</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 large eggs</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 teaspoons baking powder</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour plus 1/2 cup (65 grams) all-purpose flour, divided</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 cup (125 grams) sour cream, creme fraiche, or full-fat plain yogurt</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 gently heaped cup (140 grams or 5 ounces) fresh raspberries</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>3/4 cup (90 grams) powdered sugar</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 tablespoon raspberry puree (for a pink glaze, from a few tablespoons or 1 ounce fresh raspberries), or lemon juice</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 to 2 tablespoons milk</li></ul>Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a standard loaf pan (either 8″x4″ or 9″x5″, or any size between, will work here) with nonstick baking spray or butter, making sure to get into the corners.<p>Place sugar and salt in a large bowl. Zest lemon into sugar and rub it together with your fingertips; this helps the lemon release the most flavor from it. Add butter and use an electric mixer to beat it with the sugar until fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well with each addition. Scrape down bowl. Sprinkle cake surface with baking powder and mix it until very well combined. Scrape down sides of bowl again. Add <strong>1 cup (only)</strong> of the flour and beat just until it’s no longer visible.</p><p>Place raspberries in the bottom of a second medium-large bowl and mash with a fork until mostly broken down but still a little lumpy; you’ll have about 1/2 cup mashed. [If you really dislike raspberry seeds and/or want a smoother look, you can blend the berries until smooth and press them through a fine-mesh strainer — into this second bowl — to remove seeds.] Pour half of the cake batter on top of raspberries (if you have a scale, you can zero out the weight of the bowl and raspberries; half the batter weights 277 grams) but wait, don’t mix it yet.</p><p>Instead, go back to the first bowl of batter, the one without raspberries, and add sour cream. Beat to combine. Add <strong>1/4 cup</strong> flour, and beat just until smooth. (By beating the “white” batter first, you can reuse you beaters without washing them for the pink batter without muddying the look.)</p><p>Beat the raspberries and second half of the cake batter together until smooth. Add final <strong>1/4 cup</strong> flour, and beat just until smooth.</p><p>Dollop batters in alternating spoonfuls into bottom of prepared loaf pan. Roughly “checkerboard” the rest in, meaning that you’ll drop a pink batter dollop and then a white one and vice-versa until both batters are used up. Drop your pan onto the counter a couple times from a few inches high, to help tap out air bubbles. Use a butter knife or small offset spatula to make a few figure-8s through the batters, marbling them together — but just a little, say, 4 to 5 figure-8s. Any more and the swirls may not look distinct when you cut the cake.</p><p>Bake loaf cake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out batter-free. Let cool for 15 minutes in pan, then run a knife around cake and gently remove. Let cake cool completely on rack (I hasten this along in the freezer) before glazing, if using a glaze.</p><p>To make your glaze, place powdered sugar in a medium bowl and add raspberry puree (for this, it’s best if you press the berries through a fine-mesh sieve to remove seeds, or it won’t have a smooth pink look) or lemon juice. Whisk to combine, but it will almost definitely be too thick. From here, add milk, a teaspoon at a time, until you can whisk the sugar into a thick but loose glaze. Spoon on top of cooled cake and nudge it to the edges with your spoon or an offset spatual so that it drips where you’d like it to. Cover with sprinkles, if using.</p><p>Cake keeps for 4 to 5 days in the fridge. If there’s no milk in your glaze, you can store it at room temperature.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-36647 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-36647 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
