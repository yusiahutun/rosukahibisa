Those looking for a lifted, snatched jawline, smooth under-eye area and contoured cheeks have a new device to try. The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">NuFace Trinity+ Smart Advanced Facial Toning Device System</a> is an upgraded version of the original Trinity (which celebs such as <a href=# rel=noopener>Jennifer Aniston</a> and Bella Hadid use), with even more power and an app to ensure you’re using it to its best ability.

The Trinity+ has interchangeable microcurrent and LED Red Light attachments so you’re getting multiple treatments in one. The included Facial Trainer Attachment stimulates the larger areas of the face and neck, including those lines that are often called “tech neck.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Add the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Effective Lip & Eye Attachment</a> to get the most precise microcurrent for the nasolabial folds and those “11s” in between brows. The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Wrinkle Reducer Attachment</a>&nbsp;is larger to fit the curves of the face and reduce overall wrinkles and boost circulation.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do. <a href=# id=auto-tag_nordstrom data-tag=nordstrom>Nordstrom</a> is a STYLECASTER sponsor, however, all products in this article were independently selected by our editors.

It only takes a few minutes. Here’s how I use it: First, I wash my face with an oil-free cleanser. Then I apply a face serum or “activator,” like the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hydrating Aqua Gel Activator</a>, which comes in this value set. I apply it with the included brush area by area as I treat my face. When done, I apply eye cream, moisturizer (like <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Firming + Brightening Silk Creme Activator</a> included here!) and SPF.</p><p>You’re not going to see drastic changes right away. This isn’t plastic surgery. But it really works if you keep it up. The treatment also feels really, really nice. It’s like a much-needed spa day at home, a few minutes to yourself morning and night. You’ll start to notice an overall more lifted look and smoothed lines, especially on the neck and chin area. And be sure to use the complementary app to track your changes with selfies and get professional step-by-step tutorials tailored just for you.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShoppingNewsletter_onsitegraphic.png alt="StyleCaster Shopping Newsletter Sign Up" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWR%2BdICYcW5tZ56qs6KvxGarq6GensG6ecWamqKZnGLBsLrIp55mnJWrtqSxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
