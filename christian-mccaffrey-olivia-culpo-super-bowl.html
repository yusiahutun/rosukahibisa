The pair first appeared to connect on Instagram, when McCaffrey’s subtle gesture of liking one of Culpo’s posts sparked speculation about a blossoming relationship between the two. The romance rumors continued to grow when Culpo and McCaffrey were spotted vacationing together in Mexico in July 2019, where they were <a href=# rel=nofollow>photographed</a> enjoying the sun-drenched beaches and picturesque landscapes.</p><p>Later that fall, Culpo’s presence at McCaffrey’s football games further solidified their status as a couple. McCaffrey played for the Carolina Panthers at the time, and in true football girlfriend fashion, Culpo made sure to wear his jersey at their games. Their official red carpet debut came a year later at the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1716274>NFL Honors</a> in 2020, which coincided with the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl victory.</p><p>Not long after, Culpo reflected on their journey in an <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CfIRDotOkLl/ rel=nofollow>Instagram post</a> commemorating their third anniversary. She revealed that they were introduced to each other by friends—and she was actually hesitant to start dating the athlete. “Three years ago I was not looking for a relationship. When my best friends Kristen & Tyler called me and asked if I would be open to meeting their friend Christian I was apprehensive,” she captioned the post. “I was worried it would be the same old story all over again and that all guys were the same. While my expectations were low, I knew I couldn’t close myself off and make decisions based on fear.”</p><p>“I’m so grateful for the voice inside me that told me to give love another chance,” Culpo continued. “The yin to my yang, you are the epitome of strength through humility. Thank you for being my rock and restoring my faith in love. You are everything I ever dreamed of and more ❤️ ❤️”</p><p>Culpo and McCaffrey’s love story took another turn when the running back was traded to the San Francisco 49ers in October 2022, signaling a new chapter in their lives. Culpo bid farewell to Charlotte, North Carolina, the city that had become her home away from home, with a poignant message on <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram</a>. “This city stole my heart and I’ll never forget the memories and people who made the last 3+ years so special,” Culpo reminisced, her fondness for the Panthers’ hometown palpable. But as one door closed, another opened, and Culpo embraced her new allegiance to “Niners Nation,” standing by McCaffrey’s side as he embarked on this next step of his career.</p><p>In April 2023, the pair marked another major milestone in their relationship by getting engaged. McCaffrey orchestrated a picture-perfect proposal while on an RV trip with the model in Utah. Culpo shared intimate black-and-white photos of the moment on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a>. “We tried to keep this quiet as long as possible but apparently word travels fast,” Culpo revealed on her Instagram story at the time. “I’m marrying my best friend. I love you so much, fiancé.”</p><p>Now, it’s time for yet another adventure for these two as McCaffrey heads to the Super Bowl, where the San Francisco 49ers will face off against the Kansas City Chiefs.
