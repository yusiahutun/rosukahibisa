I work with our team in order to develop collections, buy them, and market them.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">How would you describe what you do to a toddler?​</h2><img alt="Text, Font, Circle, Label, " title="Text, Font, Circle, Label, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/outfitdissecting-lulugraham-pq1-1562873800.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I don’t know if I could! What I love about what I do is that every day is different and I’m working on a hundred things at once. To a toddler, I probably would just tell them I run around an office all day, very happy and inspired, with a bunch of really cool women.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Are you the type of person who likes to have a bunch of different things going on?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">​I am! I’m super creative, and I’m super analytical. My parents are both economists, so I grew up in a very kind of focus-metered home in Nebraska. And then I have this other part of my personality that is just super creative, loves to do musical theater, and dance. So for me, an awesome day is a day that merges both of those. Which I think is why I love merchandising. Why I love what I’m doing is because you get to do a lot of both. You look at the business and analyze what’s going on, and you get to dream about creating the next thing.</p><img alt="LULU GRAHAM" title="LULU GRAHAM" width=1080 height=853 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lulugraham-tracy3-1562873389.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">LULU GRAHAM</span></p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Did growing up in Nebraska have an effect on your style​?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think so, in just that I was so removed from the fashion sphere. J.Crew was my idea of high fashion growing up. The catalog would come in the mail and I’d dog-ear the pages. I grew up in the Delia’s era, so I didn’t grow up online. I didn’t grow up looking at fashion magazines. That really wasn’t until college when I came to NYC that my horizons were broadened to that point.</p><p>I always had this very innate view of what I wanted my personal style to be. I remember every school year starting out, and the year where all I wanted were flannel shirts and turtlenecks. The summer where I only wanted to wear printed shorts with matching T-shirts. Or the Dr. Martens phase with a certain color of socks and certain color twinset. I was always incredibly specific and had this real inner vision dictated by who knows what!</p><p>I think I still am very much the same way. I really get on a track and it works, and then I press repeat and I continue. I think I’ve always been super curious, so inspiration personally for me is never limited to x, y, and z fashion, it’s always been a refraction of everything around me.</p><img alt="Font, Text, Label, Logo, " title="Font, Text, Label, Logo, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/outfitdissecting-lulugraham-pq2-1562873834.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Have you gone back to any of those first-day-of-school looks recently?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">​It’s funny, because my mom sent me a photo of myself wearing velvet loafers, white socks, kind of baggy gym shorts, and a cool white T-shirt. I was like, “Ooh, good look, I would wear that right now!” So I think, yeah, it’s always been a high-low mix for me.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Tell me the story behind something you’re wearing right now.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My necklaces, they are something I wear every day. The stone is an ametrine from a gem healer in India that was prescribed for me. I hope it’s doing great things! It was a really special trip with one of my best friends. And then, ​Urte Tylaite​, who owns the brand Still House, did the setting for it, which is lovely. The rest are a bunch of charms from treasured friends, all sorts of things I’ve picked up along the way.</p><p>One of my best friends at work got me a protective metal for my dog. I have a zodiac charm. I have a T [charm] that I picked up on the street in Mexico when I was there earlier this year. A Jessica Winzelberg charm. And a seashell I just got at a flea market in Paris.</p><img alt="LULU GRAHAM" title="LULU GRAHAM" width=1080 height=1534 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lulugraham-tracy2-1562873539.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">LULU GRAHAM</span></p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">How would you describe your style?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tomgirl is probably the best way to describe it. But I think it’s a little more irreverent than that. I like to think I could be a character in a Woody Allen or Wes Anderson film, or dress like Woody Allen or Wes Anderson themselves. I think my love of theater and storytelling informs my style.</p><p>There are moments when I want to be super feminine or moments when I want to be super masculine. And a whole lot of days in the middle where I just end up wearing a T-shirt and jeans. I'm always looking for things that feel good on my body and make me feel a certain way. I know myself well enough to know I dress for comfort. And if it’s not comfortable, it’s not going to last in my closet. I’m a perennial closest purger, and only the really good, really comfortable, really versatile things stay. Or the vintage pieces that are very special, the jeans that fit perfectly; the good stuff sticks around.</p><img alt="LULU GRAHAM" title="LULU GRAHAM" width=1080 height=1534 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lulugraham-tracy6-1562873410.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">LULU GRAHAM</span></p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Are there any favorite brands you have found that have helped you express your personal style?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In terms of personal style, I build my wardrobe around <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.loefflerrandall.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Loeffler Randall" data-vars-ga-product-id=b4ad6f78-3c14-4b06-99ab-d6d1f1b413d9 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.loefflerrandall.com/ data-product-url=https://www.loefflerrandall.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loefflerrandall.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=97bc0a73-09e0-4a9a-8313-cc4e1c4919f4 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Loeffler Randall</a> because … accessories!

I had plenty of crazy, possibly terrible, style moments growing up. Watching a ton of Sex and the City and dreaming about New York definitely led to some fashion moments and some attempts. I went through a real skater phase, which I still partially live in, because I do love a checkered slip-on Van. I think I’ve carried pieces of these experiments with me. I still do a lot of community theater in my free time, and getting dressed for a role is one of my favorite parts of the storytelling. So I think I personally take that on as well. I try for a role to wear something I would never wear in real life. It makes it more fun, it makes it easier to step outside my life.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Were you a “dress-up kid” growing up?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was but not in an extreme way. Pretty practical. We made our own Halloween costumes; I wish I had some of those calico prairie dresses now! Laura Ingalls Wilder was very cool in Nebraska!</p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">What has the biggest influence on your style?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">​I think one of the things that really informs my style is travel. I love to travel, and I love to shop when I travel. Whether it is the local vintage store or the local flea market, or some sort of artisan, designer, garment that is culturally relevant to that place. I’ll pick up a men’s guayabera shirt in M​érida o​r an embroidered blouse when I went to the Y​ucatán​. And now that is worn with ’70s Levi’s and ballet flats, it feels very different than with a bathing suit on vacation.</p><img alt="LULU GRAHAM" title="LULU GRAHAM" width=1080 height=834 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lulugraham-tracy8-1562873432.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">LULU GRAHAM</span></p><h2 data-node-id=38 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">What is the best impulse purchase you ever made?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Maybe this belt I’m about to buy from the Hesperios store! A lot of my purchases are impulse purchases, I think you have to accept that as a vintage shopper.​ ​I will occasionally go in meditating on something I want to find, very rarely do I find it. This jacket, actually, I was in France and knew I was going to a vintage store called Le Vif. And in my head, I really wanted to complete that “stick-of-butter look.” I really wanted a tan denim jacket, and the universe threw me a bone. It was fate, we were meant to be together! But 99.99 percent of the time, it’s just a gut purchase.</p><img alt="LULU GRAHAM" title="LULU GRAHAM" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lulugraham-tracy12-1562873641.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">LULU GRAHAM</span></p><h2 data-node-id=43 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">What movie had the biggest influence on your style?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think I go through phases. Right now I’m looking at old photos of Ali MacGraw and Jean Seberg. I asked a friend to describe my style and they said, “Perfect jeans, lively top, flat shoes, and a good handbag.” I think that really sums it up. I went to see “The Cher Show,” and for weeks after that, I was like, “I need rhinestone earrings and a diamanté belt!” So I think whatever I’m seeing and what’s in my immediate consciousness ends up seeping in, rather than one tent-post movie for me.</p><h2 data-node-id=45 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">If you could be dropped in any time period strictly for the clothes, which would you pick?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Definitely the ’60s right now. Really good jeans. I’m really interested in the khakis, the putties. Today I was looking at images from Pitti online, and I saw a man in a forest green suit with a buttercream yellow piped pajama shirt and a maroon baseball hat. The color combination blew my mind. I absolutely think being in the ’60s/’70s would be a dream. I think I would dress like a similar version of myself, but all the clothes would be new and in stores! They wouldn’t be vintage, it would be so fun!</p><h2 data-node-id=47 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Do you think you’d go back (to that time period) and buy vintage?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I​ don’t think so. It’s funny you ask that, and I immediately think of Midnight in Paris, and, you know, I would go back and I would tell you I wouldn’t buy vintage. But everyone would be wistful and buying vintage from the ’20s and ’30s and saying they wanted to live there. I think it would be great to go back to that era with the music and the style. There is something so very restrained and particular that I really like about those eras.</p><img alt="LULU GRAHAM" title="LULU GRAHAM" width=1080 height=853 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw
