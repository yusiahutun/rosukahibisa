For the latest installment of the highly popular video series &#34;Gym & Fridge&#34; (for Men's Health), the actor answered the door to his New Zealand warehouse/artist commune with an open bathrobe.

I gotta share things with them,” Momoa said. "I'm doing everything that I want to do, everything that I'm designed to do. And you’ve got to do that. I want my children to know that and do that."</p><p>"I worked for a very long time when they were young doing shit I didn’t want to do to put food on the table. And now? You should only work with the people you wanna work with. You should create with the people you wanna create with," he continued. "And if you’re not, then you got one shot in this life—you gotta get the fuck out. Whatever situation you’re in, you gotta find your path, you know?"</p><p>For more on what Momoa said check out the full interview <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d549ae69-fb1c-4dc6-bd0e-8922fc921e65 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6eb82ce5-a538-4fe7-911f-e5a170fb377a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a4/5by4/2022/11/10/a48b476b72eb43689aa8321f534fbf9f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jason Momoa Strips Down to Viral Fishing Hawaiian Malo, Flexes Derriere on Kimmel</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21ma29fn660u81mpKiln5Z6r8HDnmSbnZWnerHBzZyfnqtdl7assdJmop6spKGyo7HLpapmpZWjwG60xJqjraBf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
