Jarvis and Bent began discussing what to do with the jug of rubbing alcohol.</span><br></p><p><span>'That's when they're like, "We should pour it on him just to mess with him",' Kenny told police.

They yelled that he should stop, drop and roll, but he was heading for an apartment complex pool. He jumped the fence and plunged into the water.</span><br></p><p><span>The group of boys scattered in several directions. Jarvis dropped the empty rubbing alcohol jug into a garbage can.<br></span></p><p><span>Brewer tore off his burning shirt, leaving a scorched area in the grass where it landed. The alcohol also ignited a small fire in some bushes.

'Somebody poured stuff on him.'</span><br></p><p><span>'Please help me!' Brewer yelled over and over.</span><br></p><p><span>Paramedics arrived and Brewer was airlifted to a Miami hospital.
