The week leading up to her special day has been a busy one for Camilla. The Duchess attended the christening of little Prince Louis,&nbsp;as well as observing the <a class=hm-link href=#>RAF centenary flyover</a> from the balcony of Buckingham Palace. She also enjoyed a day out at <a class=hm-link href=#>Wimbledon </a>with her sister Annabel to watch the men's quarter finals last week, and looked elegant in a pale pink and white polka dot dress. Last year, Camilla held a garden party in the grounds of Clarence House to celebrate her milestone <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>70th birthday</a>,</strong> and this year it will be the turn of her husband, <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Charles</a>, to mark his 70th. However Camilla chooses to celebrate her 71st birthday, we hope she has a great time!</p><h2>18&nbsp;July: Priyanka Chopra turns 36</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3d4dd4350eb4-priyanka-z.jpg><p id=eYE0FrSxFp-1T data-wc=137>Wednesday is a special day for actress <a class=hm-link href=#>Priyanka Chopra</a> – it's her birthday! She has been delighting fans with her blossoming relationship with singer<a class=hm-link href=#> Nick Jonas</a>, and rumour has it that she will be spending her special day with him. A source close to the couple said that they are planning to have a small gathering with friends in New York before Priyanka returns to Mumbai to begin filming her latest movie – Bharat. Proving their romance is as strong ever, Priyanka and Nick recently enjoyed a trip to her native India with her other half. The Quantico star opened up about the trip, during which Nick met her mother and attended a friend's wedding, saying: "We're getting to know each other and I think it was a great experience for him. It was really beautiful. He had a great time."</p><h2>19&nbsp;July: Benedict Cumberbatch turns 42</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0074b176e336-benedict-z.jpg><p id=eEpVWhXbf4OIA data-wc=98>Happy Birthday to British actor <a class=hm-link href=#>Benedict Cumberbatch</a>, who this week turns 42. He has a lot to celebrate at the moment, as last week he received his sixth Emmy nomination, for his lead role in the dark comedy Patrick Melrose. "I was in a car going home and my phone just blew. I thought 'Whoa, what's going on here, is there a malfunction?',"&nbsp;said the Sherlock Holmes star of the moment he realised the news. What's more, Benedict will star in an upcoming Channel 4 drama about the EU referendum and will portray Dominic Cummings, a Vote Leave campaigner.</p><h2>22&nbsp;July: Prince George turns 5</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4673760920a8-prince-george-z.jpg><p id=eoYn6XqP0SxOB data-wc=103>Happy 5th Birthday to <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince George</a>, who celebrates his special day on Sunday. It's hard to believe that it has been five years since the world watched the door of the Lindo Wing at St Mary's hospital, Paddington, eagerly anticipating the<a class=hm-link href=#> birth of the future King</a>. Since then, Prince George has won the hearts of the nation during his adorable public appearances. Just last week, he joined his family at his little brother Prince Louis' christening, and looked captivated whilst <a class=hm-link href=#>watching the RAF flypast</a> with his sister <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Charlotte</a> from a side window. The cheeky pair seemed to enjoy the display, with Charlotte playfully sticking her tongue out and George excitedly waving at the crowds.</p><h2>22&nbsp;July: Selena Gomez turns 26</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ab63298b3516-selena-z.jpg><p id=ed2LWi2Dwrg39 data-wc=98>Happy Birthday to <a class=hm-link href=#>Selena Gomez</a>, who shares her big day with Prince George! &nbsp;The former Disney star is very busy at the moment. During an appearance on US chatshow Good Morning America, Selena was asked if she had any plans for her 26th birthday. She replied, "I might be working on my birthday,"&nbsp;before adding: "It is [a good thing]. I'm very lucky. I'm grateful."&nbsp;Earlier this month, the Hands to Myself singer stunned in a<a class=hm-link href=#> blue and white floral ensemble</a> at the premiere of her latest film Hotel Transylvania 3, which was very similar to the outfit worn by the <a class=hm-link href=#>Duchess of Sussex</a> to the <a class=hm-link href=#>wedding of Celia McCorquodale</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQcWdwaWZqfXOClmianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaKqpJ2xosXSZmhvZWJneqvBy7Jm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
