"I thought, 'Oh God, what do I do now? Do I have to do dating? How repulsive. I'll have to buy new pants.' I did do some dating and it was excruciating and difficult as I'm not an accomplished flirter. Then, bang, I met somebody else. I started to claim my life back. It's a life with him. I know that I will make a good life for myself with all sorts of things as armour. Including stuff my new chap is teaching me that I never knew. Now my life is in Cornwall with him. I hope it is a life together."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d848bca4d06d-dawn-french-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eFs-PLwh7rRz data-wc=9><strong>The actress tied the knot with Mark in 2013</strong></p><p id=edS8HMnlEcFX data-wc=84>"I 100 per cent thought I would be on my own – but that didn’t bother me," she said, reports .
