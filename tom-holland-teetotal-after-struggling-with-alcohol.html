It was all I could think about. I was waking up thinking about it, I was checking the clock, 'When’s it 12?' And it just really scared me. I was like, 'Wow, maybe I have a little bit of an alcohol thing,' so I sort of decided to just punish myself and say I'll do February as well, I'll do two months off."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5ac471b1662a-tom-holland-zendaya-t.jpg><p id=eUdhFYB2TSo data-wc=54>He continued that he really struggled with the challenge and found things like socialising and going out for dinner much more difficult, adding: "I started to really worry that I had an alcohol problem." The actor then made the decision to keep going until his birthday to prove that he didn’t have an issue.</p><p id=eZX37L9Ebl data-wc=16><strong>MORE: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Tom Hollan​d reveals emotional impact of creepy new series on him: 'It did break me'</a></p><p id=eRIYzpIpuM0 data-wc=97>He said: "I said to myself, if I can do six months without alcohol, then I can prove to myself that I don't have a problem. By the time I got to June 1, I was the happiest I had ever been in my life… Things that would go wrong on set that would normally set me off, I could take in my stride… I felt healthier, I felt fitter and I just sort of said to myself, why am I enslaved to this drink? Why am I so obsessed with the idea of having this drink?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eb846be05ad4-tom-holland-zendaya-relationship-timeline.jpg><p id=e_nIv9IQ6MV3 data-wc=46>The actor, who is currently in a relationship with Zendaya, added: "If I could encourage someone to drink less, that would be great. But I don’t want to start getting into the world of, 'You need to stop drinking.' Because it’s not for me to say."&nbsp;</p><p id=eVXfg7PK_z25 data-wc=51>Tom, 27, recently confirmed that he would be taking a break from acting after his role in The Crowded Room, telling Extra: "I really enjoyed it, but then again, the show did break me.

"I remember having a bit of a meltdown at home and thinking, like, 'I'm going to shave my head. I need to shave my head because I need to get rid of this character.' And, obviously, we were mid-shooting, so I decided not to… It was unlike anything I've ever experienced before."&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
