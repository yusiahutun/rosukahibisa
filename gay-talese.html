He spent about nine years as a sports writer for The New York Times. Later, Talese moved to Esquire.</p><p>In 1966, he published an article in Esquire, called – “Frank Sinatra Has a Cold.” In the article, Gay wrote:</p><p><strong>”The most distinguishing thing about Sinatra’s face are his eyes, clear blue and alert, eyes that within seconds can go cold with anger, or glow with affection, or, as now, reflect a vague detachment that keeps his friends silent and distant.”</strong></p><p>Vanity Fair called the article “the greatest literary-nonfiction story of the 20th century.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59812 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/talese-author.jpg.webp alt="talese author" width=1200 height=1100 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/talese-author.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-59812 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Michael Kinsley, an American political journalist, said:</p><p><strong>“It’s hard to imagine a magazine article today having the kind of impact that [this] article and others had in those days in terms of everyone talking about it purely on the basis of the writing and the style.”</strong></p><p>In 1969, Talese published a book, titled – ”The Kingdom and the Power.” It was about the inner workings of The NY Times. It became Gay’s first bestseller.</p><p>In 1970, Gay released a book entitled – ”Fame and Obscurity: A Book About New York, a Bridge, and Celebrities on the Edge.” It included some of his most famous celebrity profiles – The Silent Season of a Hero, Frank Sinatra Has a Cold, or Joe Louis: The King as a Middle-aged Man.</p><p>In 1971, he published a book named – ”Honor Thy Father.” The book is about the travails of the Bonanno crime family in the 1960s.</p><p>In 1981, Talese released another book, titled – ”Thy Neighbor’s Wife.” The book was hailed as a pioneer in the study of sexuality.</p><p>In preparation for writing the book, he resided for a few months at Sandstone Retreat, a clothing-optional resort for swingers. The book was updated in 2009.</p><p>In 1992, he published ”Unto the Sons.” It traces the origins of Gay’s own family, beginning with his great-grandfather in Maida, Italy.</p><p>In 2006, Talese wrote – ”A Writer’s Life.” The autobiography details both the meticulousness and serendipity of Talese in getting a story. It also tells about a rejected article by New Yorker editor Tina Brown about <a href=#>Lorena</a> and <a href=#>John Bobbitt</a>, on which Gay worked for about six months.</p><p>In 2011, he won the Norman Mailer Prize for Distinguished Journalism.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59813 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gay-talese-books.jpg.webp alt="gay talese books" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gay-talese-books.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-59813 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>In 2016, Gay published a book entitled – ”The Voyeur’s Motel.” The book is about Gerald Foos, the former owner of the Manor House Motel, who had been systematically spying on his guests since 1966.</p><p>In addition, Foos had kept “records” of all the guests that he spied on. According to Gay, Gerald sees himself as “a pioneering researcher whose efforts were comparable to those of the renowned sexologists at the Kinsey Institute.”</p><p>During an interview, Talese stated:</p><p><strong>”You feel like a voyeur, but I tell you, I was a voyeur before I met Gerald Foos.”</strong></p><p>In June 2016, the credibility of The Voyeur’s Motel was questioned when it came to light that Gerald Foos had made false statements to Gay, which the author did not verify.</p><p>In 2018, Talese was nominated for the New Jersey Hall of Fame in the Arts and Letters category.</p><h2><strong>Wife</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59807 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gay-Talese-and-wife-Nan-Talese.jpg.webp alt="Gay Talese and wife Nan Talese" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gay-Talese-and-wife-Nan-Talese.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-4 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-59807 class=wp-caption-text>Gay Talese with wife – October 6, 1971 in New York – @Getty</p><p>On June 10, 1959, Gay Talese married Nan Talese, a veteran of the New York publishing industry.</p><p>She has been the Editorial Director of her own imprint, Nan A.
