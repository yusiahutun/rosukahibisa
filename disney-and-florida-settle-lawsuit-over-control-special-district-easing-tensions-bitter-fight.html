reached a settlement to end a high-profile lawsuit in state court over the control of the special district that includes Walt Disney World in Orlando, the company said on Wednesday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Disney also agreed to drop a late 2023 lawsuit over access to public records and defer briefings in the federal lawsuit it filed

e1346ty31">“This agreement opens a new chapter of constructive engagement with the new leadership of the district,” Walt Disney World President Jeff Vahle said.</p><img

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">DeSantis and Disney, one of Florida’s biggest employers, have been embroiled in a dispute since 2022 when former CEO Bob Chapek criticised a state legislative effort to limit classroom discussion of sexuality and gender issues for younger pupils, a bill that critics call the “Don’t Say Gay” measure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Florida board appointed by DeSantis to oversee development around Disney’s theme parks sued the company to void “back-room deals” favourable to the entertainment conglomerate.</p>The clash was a centrepiece of DeSantis’ speeches last year as he sought the Republican nomination for US president and bashed the company as “woke <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Disney</span></a>”.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">DeSantis later limited his public attacks on the company and dropped out of the presidential race in January.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Disney sues Florida Governor DeSantis over ‘retaliation’</span></p></a></h3>The settlement showed that both sides wanted to move past the skirmish and restore the historically strong relationship between Disney and state officials, said David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Florida</span></a> who is now an independent.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jolly said he believed DeSantis and his allies lost their appetites for the battle once the governor exited the presidential contest.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It made sense for his politics,” Jolly said. “It never made sense for Florida’s economy or for the long-term interests of the state.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Disney’s four theme parks in Orlando attracted roughly 47 million visitors in 2022, according to industry statistics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/28/3322ba19-2722-4f38-82fb-71b3c635220e_ae37834e.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, DeSantis said the state’s actions had been “vindicated”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A year ago people were trying to act like all these legal manoeuvres were all going to succeed, and the reality is here we are a year later, not one of them has succeeded,” he told reporters, according to The New York Times.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under the terms of the settlement, Disney agreed not to challenge the oversight board’s view that the land use plan adopted by the previous board, in the waning days of its oversight of Walt Disney World, is invalid.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That would leave a plan adopted in 2020 as the working blueprint for the Orlando theme parks and retail district. Disney also agreed to drop a lawsuit over access to public records.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Members of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District approved the settlement at a meeting on Wednesday. The agreement was reached after the departures of board chairman Martin Garcia and the district’s administrator, Glen Gilzean.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Disney cancels plans for US$1 billion campus, 2,000 jobs in Florida</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’re eager to work with Disney and other businesses within Central Florida to make our destination known for world-class attractions and accountable governance,” Central Florida Tourism Oversight District Vice Chairman Charbel Barakat said on Wednesday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the federal suit, Disney had accused DeSantis of “weaponising” government by punishing the company for exercising free speech rights. A judge dismissed that lawsuit in January, but Disney appealed. The appeal is now paused while the sides hold talks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Florida legislature created the Reedy Creek Improvement District in 1967 to promote the development of Walt Disney World on 38.5-square miles of land.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Disney paid taxes to that district, which provided municipal services and exempted it from some regulations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company’s shares rose 0.9 per cent to close at US$120.98 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXy2usitnJ1lo6mutbHSZpqappGZrnCt0a2gnKSVZIBzgZVycGtnlJ7Ar7HYZpinnF2bubC%2ByJ2YZquVqcGtsYylmLCrpZ7BbrvVnqlmm5%2BjwbO7y2aqqZ2Tnq6tecOiqq2qmZjBbrHArKCnn12psq%2B%2FyKilrGWSnsG1sdFmnaKfmKk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
