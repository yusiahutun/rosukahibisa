They launched their “Ultra Right Beer” earlier this year following their successful “Bud Light” can. This move made headlines as the company partnered with famous transgender social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney.&nbsp;</p><p>However, its conservative consumers nationwide did not like this; their response was proof enough. Therefore, it looks like the brand is trying to turn things around to please its target audience with a new promotion.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Is President Joe Biden a Conservative?</a></strong></p><p>Recently, the beer company announced its “Real Women of America” 2024 Calendar, which some believe is insulting to <a href=#>transgender athletes/women</a>. According to the company, this calendar is the first of its kind designed to “specifically showcase the most beautiful conservative women in America.”</p><p>In this calendar, they partnered with anti-trans activist Riley Gaines, a former NCAA swimmer. The retired athlete is always vocal about her stance on transgender women participating in female sports. Furthermore, she is constantly on the frontlines at hearings and interviews, fighting for what she believes is fairness in female sports.&nbsp;</p><p>Gaines is the cover model of the calendar, posing in a bathing suit with the colors of the American flag. According to their website, this calendar features “the most beautiful conservative women in America.” These include Gaines herself and several other American women from different races and backgrounds.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#><strong>POLL — Should Public Schools Include Critical Race Theory and Sex Education in Their Curriculum?</strong></a></p><p>They are Dana Loesch, Kim Klacik, Ashley St. Clair, Sara Gonzales, Josie ‘The Redheaded Libertarian,’ Catalina Lauf, Brittany Jean, Bethany Bartlett, and Peyton Drew. There are also “fun, none-woke” messages throughout the calendar to look for.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the company believes the calendar is a “celebration of conservative women who are fighting woke extremists to preserve real women.” As Gaines is the cover model and most famous face on the calendar, her deal with the company favors her and her NGO.</p><p>Therefore, Conservative Dad’s Ultra Right Beer will donate 10% of all its calendar sales to the Riley Gaines Center.&nbsp;The company released the limited-edition calendar to the public on December 6 on its website.</p><p>Without a doubt, conservatives love it and are eagerly buying it at its price of $25. On the other hand, several non-conservatives see this as an insult to the transgender community. However, the CEO addressed this matter in an interview with Fox News.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Pope Francis Punishes Critic Cardinal Burke in Second Action Against Conservative Critics</a></strong></p><p>He said, “This calendar is in no way intended to discredit transwomen… because there is no such thing as a ‘transwoman.” “We’ve reached incredibly stupid times when it’s ‘controversial’ to say men can’t be women. This calendar will serve as a reminder men can never replace the beautiful women of America,” he added.&nbsp;</p><p>Conservative Dad’s calendar has caused a lot of discussions among Americans and social media users. The message on the back page of the calendar is also a topic of debate among many. It claims that woke culture is working overtime to destroy “patriotism, fast cars, fun, and real women.”&nbsp;</p><p>Do you agree?</p><p><strong>You Might Also Like</strong>:</p><p><a href=#>Local Coroners Are Being Forced To Evolve As More Migrants Bite the Dust</a></p><p><a href=#>Democrats Turn on Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson’s Administration Over Immigrant Crisis</a></p><p><a href=#>Newly Appointed St Louis Prosecutor Says He’s Enforcing Laws Amid Crime Crackdown</a></p><p><a href=#>Scientist Reveals He Helped Discredit Covid Lab Leak Theory</a></p><p><a href=#>Taxes to Skyrocket as Trump-Era Tax Cuts Are Set to Expire</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksLC60p6pr5mknsOmecOam6xlkaPBqnnWqKKeZZOWuaa6w5qpZquglr%2Bsv4yprJukmZh6pbXSnKauqqOafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
