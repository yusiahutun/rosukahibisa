The shooter told at least one student he wouldn't hurt them, Kennedy said, and after lining the remaining students up against a wall complained that no one was willing to listen to him about unspecified problems. The shooter then set the gun down and turned away from it.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/08/article-2200142-14E5147E000005DC-847_634x438.jpg height=438 width=634 alt="Worst nightmare: Anxious parents are seen outside the school anticipating their reunion with their sons and daughters after the alleged lone gunman fired at least two shots into the ceiling" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Worst nightmare: Anxious parents are seen outside the school anticipating their reunion with their sons and daughters after the alleged lone gunman fired at least two shots into the ceiling</p><p><span>'My teacher, he stood up and ran, grabbed the gun and then (the shooter) jumped on top of the teacher's back,' Kennedy said, adding that a second shot was discharged during the struggle.<br></span></p><p><span>Officers who entered the classroom just after 8 a.m. after receiving a number of 911 calls found the teacher, whose name was not released, had the student under control, Bleichner said.<br></span></p><p><span>'How he obtained that weapon, we're still investigating that,' the police chief said.<br></span></p><p><span>According to WJBC, investigators believe the student may have been bullied.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/08/article-2200142-14E51472000005DC-11_634x446.jpg height=446 width=634 alt="Reunited: Laura Lawson hugs her son, Colegraham, 17, a senior at the school, after they were reunited at the nearby Eastview Christian Church" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Reunited: Laura Lawson hugs her son, Colegraham, 17, a senior at the school, after they were reunited at the nearby Eastview Christian Church</p><p><span>Parents were told about the incident through the school's electronic alert system and told later in the morning to pick up their children at the church, a process that took several hours because the school required parents to show photo identification and sign each child out of school, McLean County Unit District No. 5 Superintendent Gary Niehaus said. Those who couldn't be picked up were being bussed home late in the afternoon.<br></span></p><p><span>Classes in the school district's other five schools went on Friday afternoon, but the Normal Community campus remained closed as a crime scene, according to the school district's website.

A football game scheduled for Friday night was moved to Saturday.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/08/article-2200142-14E5145F000005DC-261_634x427.jpg height=427 width=634 alt="Waiting game: Other concerned parents are seen outside the Eastview Christian Church, waiting to hear word on their children's safety" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Waiting game: Other concerned parents are seen outside the Eastview Christian Church, waiting to hear word on their children's safety</p><p><span>Classes at Normal Community are expected to resume Monday, Niehaus said, and potential changes such as the addition of metal detectors already were being discussed.
