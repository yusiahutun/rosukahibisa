The 1987 romantic fantasy is about invisible angels living in Berlin, trying to comfort a group of sad humans. Undercover creative director Jun Takahashi was clearly inspired by the angelic, and his collection of dresses with transparent shrouding and sheer organza tailoring comforted a group of very real sad humans: fashion industry professionals complaining that Paris was looking a little too bleak and wearable this season.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While designers have been sending out clothing for real life (or, some might even argue, the afterlife, with so much black everywhere), Takahashi sent out pieces built for something far more divine. When the lights went down, guests thought the show was over, but instead, three models in strapless dresses floated down the runway, appearing to glow from within. Their clear skirts were serving as terrariums, specked with real flowers and filled with live butterflies dancing about.</p><img alt=undercover title=undercover width=3046 height=4569 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1704477914-65157dff473d7.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">getty</span></p><img alt=undercover title=undercover width=3046 height=4569 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1704477885-65157dffd4043.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">getty</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The moment quickly went viral, with fans online exclaiming the dresses had made them fall in love with fashion again this season. Some compared it to the sort of magical creation one might see in a Studio Ghibli movie or a Disney fairy tale. Others said it reminded them of the kind of dresses they would dream up as a child.</p><img alt=undercover title=undercover width=3046 height=4569 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1704478892-65157e00449b4.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">getty</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And it’s true—the dresses felt like something invented by a wide-eyed kid, which is why it’s so delightful to see thousands of otherwise fairly serious adults fawning over them. It’s easy to be cynical these days, about clothing and everything else, but Takahashi offered up a welcome and heavenly distraction.</p><img alt=undercover title=undercover width=3111 height=4666 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1693295338-65157e011507f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">getty</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Backstage, the designer mentioned morality and shared that he was grieving for people he was close to. His translator said, “He feels like he’s stuck in the world, but he wants to release himself.” Throughout the collection, Takahashi expressed this idea literally, with the sheer materials of his garments revealing items like playing cards or razors. He took banal instances of humanity, often just hidden away in pockets, and put them on display behind shrouding, transforming them into something phantasmagorical.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But nothing felt more otherworldly than his terrarium dresses, which freed everyone in the audience from themselves for a brief moment of fashion fantasy. The butterflies, too, he assured us, would be released after the show.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
