Few things feel as cozy as the blend of sweat, intimacy and orgasm-induced dopamine that characterizes any post-sex cuddle sesh.

Its most obvious application involves sleepy morning sex—you know, the kind where you’re too tired to do much but too turned-on to do nothing. But it’s also an opportunity to take the whole (admittedly hackneyed) Netflix & Chill thing to the next level. Imagine catching up on your favorite show while cuddling&nbsp;while getting it on. (What can we say? 2019 has brought out our inner multitasker.)</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/promescent-fi.jpg><p>Whether you’re sleepy, turned-on or just craving some low-key orgasmic cuddles, you surely can’t deny that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">cuddle sex</a> sounds like a beautiful, magical, wonderful thing. And the following <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">cuddle sex positions</a> just want you to have a little more of that beautiful, magical, wonderful thing in your life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/spooning-sex.png><h2 class=p1><strong><span class=s1>1. Spooning Sex</span></strong></h2><p>An absolute classic, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">spooning sex is a go-to for pleasure-filled cuddles</a>—and offers all kinds of ways to play. Whether you’re one for anal or vaginal penetration—and/or nipple or genital stimulation—the big spoon holds the pleasure key, and all the little spoon has to do is lean in. Plus, it’s the perfect position for extra ear and neck nibbling—meaning it’s basically a one-stop shop for everything that is beautiful in this world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/hand-play-sex.png><h2 class=p1><strong><span class=s1>2. Intimate Hand Play</span></strong></h2><p>Get ready for some intense eye contact, close holding and lots of pleasure. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Hand play is the perfect position for cuddle lovers</a>, because both persons (or all, if there are more than two of you) involved can come face-to-face and pull each other as close as they want. This is perfect for hot and sweaty makeouts, fingering, hand-jobs and sex toy play (both the vagina and the perineum—the rarely talked about pleasure sensor between the vagina and anus, or scrotum and anus—are easily accessible from this position).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/straddle-sex.png><h2 class=p1><strong><span class=s1>3. Sitting-Up Straddle</span></strong></h2><p>Have your partner sit down on a couch, chair or bed. Climb on top of them and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">wrap your legs around their waist</a>. This is a great pretzel-like position for vaginal or anal penetration (with or without a dildo). Being face-to-face, this position provides room for plenty of kisses and allows you both to wrap your arms around each other for some loving cuddles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/lazy-dog-sex.png><h2 class=p1><strong><span class=s1>4. Modified Doggy Style / Prone Bone</span></strong></h2><p>Think doggy-style, but lying down on your stomach with your partner lying on top of you. This position works for vaginal or anal penetration, and it also gives your partner the option of reaching around to stimulate your genitals.&nbsp;The extra amount of pressure from them lying on top of you will be sure to get you (and them) off in no time—all while feeling like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">you’re receiving a big hug from behind</a>. Yes, please!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/relaxed-oral.png><h2 class=p1><span class=s1><strong>5. Relaxed Oral</strong></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Have your partner sit or lie down comfortably on their back, while you lie on your stomach between their legs. Wrap your arms behind the legs, just under their butt, and pull their pleasure spot up to your mouth. This not only offers leverage but provides an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">intimate and sexy way to provide stimulation</a>. Once your partner has finished, switch off and take turns. The more cuddle sex, the merrier—right?</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/side-by-side-sex.png><h2 class=p1><strong><span class=s1>6. Side by Side</span></strong></h2><p class=p1>There’s nothing that satisfies those cuddle cravings more than tangling up your legs with your partners’. Try lying down, facing each other. Have one person wrap their leg over the other’s hip, providing the perfect spot for penetration, both vaginal and anal. Think of this as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">your favorite sleep position—but sexier</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/face-sitting-sex.png><h2 class=p1><strong><span class=s1>7. Face Sitting</span></strong></h2><p>While the term “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">sit on my face</a>” doesn’t necessarily scream cuddly, think about the intimacy and closeness required in this position. This provides ultimate eye contact while the person on top can reach behind to stimulate the other person’s genitals. The bottom player can then wrap their arms around the top’s legs, or reach up and hold onto their waist, bringing a hand-to-body (and mouth-to-body) body connection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uorZ5lo5rFcIWXcWdvbF%2BYwqWwy55krJ2oYr2wv8itoKimo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
