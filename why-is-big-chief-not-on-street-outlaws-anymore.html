Unfortunately, he has not been seen in any of the episodes, leading some to wonder if he was removed from the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Big Chief done with 'Street Outlaws'?</h2><p>In the past, he has stepped away from the show to focus on himself and his family, so it's possible he decided to do that again for Season 4 and Season 5, which would explain his absence.</p><p>It's uncertain whether or not Big Chief will resolve his issues with the show's production. In the meantime, he has continued to share some street racing-related content on both Instagram and on his YouTube channel, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Midwest Street Cars</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will Big Chief return to 'Street Outlaws'?</h2><p>While Big Chief has been absent from Street Outlaws and No Prep Kings, the street racer did appear in Season 2 of America's List. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on Instagram</a> in November of 2021 that he had been filming the show, which let people know they could expect to see him there.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Thank you to everyone [who] has supported us here and over there in our new adventure on YouTube!!! You guys are truly the best! Should have the crow running later today, and testing on asphalt this weekend!" Chief wrote. "America's List starts filming its [second] season in 11 days, and a huuuge announcement will be coming shortly after, about possibly the biggest craziest thing that's ever happened in Street Outlaws history!!!! And we will be ready!!!! Buckle up! Things are about to get wild!!!!"</p><p>However, America's List has not yet been renewed for a third season, and many are under the impression that it will be canceled because Big Chief has left its lineup as well. He hasn't addressed his absence from the Street Outlaws franchise since March of 2022, but we'll be ready for an update whenever he does.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZJuhl2KwqbXEn2Snp6RivK950q2pnp2kYry2wMuarqxlkaPGrrvRng%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
