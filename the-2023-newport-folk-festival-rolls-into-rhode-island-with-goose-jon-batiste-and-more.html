Fans in attendance will likely witness a few surprises and unannounced appearances during the weekend’s festivities. Still, there is already an impressive list of confirmed sets that feature an array of artists set to join forces on the festival stage.</p><p>“Dawn Landes & Friends Perform the Liberated Woman’s Songbook,” hosted by the singer-songwriter and producer <strong>Josh Kaufman</strong>, will feature appearances from special guests to benefit RIOT Rhode Island. The Providence-based nonprofit empowers and supports cis women, girls, and trans and nonbinary individuals interested in music.</p><p>The “Folk Family Revue” will feature intimate sets from <strong>Robert Ellis, Beau Bedford</strong>, and <strong>Phil</strong> <strong>Cook</strong>. Accomplished singer-songwriter&nbsp;<strong>John Oates</strong>&nbsp;will be joined by celebrated guitarist <strong>Guthrie Trapp</strong> for a special joint appearance, highlighting many of Oates’ solo songs and hits from Hall & Oates.</p><p>See this writer’s recommendations below if you’re heading to Rhode Island or the weekend.</p><p><strong><u>Goose </u></strong>– Goose is to Connecticut like <strong>Phish</strong> is to Vermont. The jam-groove-hippie band played the NFF last year but has so much more to offer for 2023 – more songs, experience, and excitement. Don’t miss the quintet jamming to their well-respected and received covers such as “Please Forgive Me” by David Gray, “Inside Out” by Spoon or The Moody Blues “Nights in White Satin.” Don’t miss them.</p><p><strong><u>Maggie Rogers</u></strong> – Her original material is stellar, but who can forget her cover of John Prine’s “Angel from Montgomery” in 2019 … Rogers belongs at Fort Adams. With her 2022 album, Surrender, crowds should dance and sing along to the tracks “Light On” or “Back in My Body.” Maybe, just maybe, <strong>The Band</strong> will show up for a duet of “The Weight.” It IS the NFF, so you never know who will hit the stage from behind the curtain.</p><p>In addition, the Newport Jazz Festival comes to town from August 4 – 6. The NFF is now sold-out, but you can register for the waiting list and purchase tickets for the upcoming Newport Jazz Festival <a href=#><span>HERE</span></a>.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4BwfJZoaW9npJ2ybn6Pa2pmppWsvbC%2B02adqKSbYrOmv9OirZqkXae8rbjSZqCnrJ9iv6m7w55koquclruledaiq6Fll6S8tLGMo6anZZKWwaq%2F055kmqaUYrqwvsRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
