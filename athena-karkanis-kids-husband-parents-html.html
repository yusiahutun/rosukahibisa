She wrote</p><p>I found myself overcome with emotion, thinking about how momentous this return to the stage is. As a performer (who's first many years of her career were on the stage) and as a lover of theatre and dance, I felt so happy and grateful to be there and to be sharing it with my children.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Moreover, the kids loved the show, too, making mama extra happy to share the love of performing with them.
