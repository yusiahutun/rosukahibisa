Artificial Intelligence has caused a stir this year with the likes of raising popularity with AI generated images, as well as tools like ChatGPT. Now, fears have grown that our beloved stars are no longer safe.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tom-hanks-warns-against-ai-fake>Tom Hanks warns against AI fake</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-903125674-1-1024x724.jpg><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> wrote a simple message to followers on Sunday, October 1, to get the warning across. On <a href=#>Instagram</a>, he shared a screenshot of the AI clip, avoiding posting the entire video in case it caught fans’ attention for the wrong reasons.</p><p>He explained he has “nothing to do with it” at all, before some movie fans get fooled.</p><p>He wrote: “BEWARE! There’s a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me.</p><p>“I have nothing to do with it.”</p><p>It comes after AI’s developing software is becoming more realistic, like this <a href=#>Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper wedding photo</a> seemingly eerily real.</p><p>Tom’s real concerns focus on adoring fans believing he endorsed the product, which he didn’t, and they would in turn get duped into buying it. It’s also scary to think how his face and voice could be used digitally to say whatever the person/company wants.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-movie-star-has-spoken-out-against-ai-before>The movie star has spoken out against AI before</h2><p>It’s not the first time Tom Hanks has discussed AI and the ever-growing developments of technology.</p><p>In May this year, The Green Mile star told the Adam Buxton Podcast how he thinks it could impact his own <a href=#>movie</a> career.</p><p>He also explained it’s been playing on his mind ever since his Christmas hit, Polar Express. The film was released back in 2004 – almost 20 years ago.</p><p>“We saw this coming,” Tom said.</p><p>“We saw that there was going to be this ability […] to take zeros and ones inside a computer and turn it into a face and a character. Now, that has only grown a billion-fold since then, and we see it everywhere.”</p><p>But he also opened up over the fears that viewers wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. Real actors wouldn’t be easy to spot anymore.</p><p>“Anybody can now recreate themselves at any age they are by way of AI or deepfake technology,” Tom added.</p><p>“Look, I could be hit by a bus tomorrow and that’s it, but my performances can go on and on and on and on.</p><p>“And outside of the understanding that it’s been done with AI and deepfake, there’ll be nothing to tell you that it’s not me and me alone.”</p><p>Now, it seems, one of his fears is coming true.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hollywood-s-relationship-with-ai>Hollywood’s relationship with AI</h2><p>The recent SAG-AFTRA strike, which forced TV shows and movies to grind to a halt, also had concerns over technology. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union’s chief negotiator, explained the union was concerned over using actors’ likeness.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>warned</a> studios want to scan extras and background actors, and then use AI to re-ruse actors in future projects. This would mean they’d have access to them “for the rest of eternity”. But the problem lies with how the studios wouldn’t have consent from the stars themselves, and because it would be technology, there are fears over whether they would be paid at all.</p><p>But, it could also face <a href=# rel=nofollow>writers</a> as well, with the likes of ChatGPT and bot popularity rising.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2V%2FcMDHnmSsm5Gnxm7CyJ2cqGWkna61edOopGagkaO4tHnWmqWtq12jvLW0yKeeZqyfYrGwedaiq6Fn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
