But if you’re like me, wearing a heavy, oil-controlling foundation with a flat-matte finish feels just plain wrong during the summertime, especially if you’re spending more time outdoors and looking for a simplified beauty routine. For me, beauty should be care-free and low maintenance during summer, not a hassle. While BB and CC creams are traditionally associated with having more hydrating formulas and dewy finishes, if you’re looking to get the fuss-free blendability, fast application and skincare-enhanced benefits of one of these complexion multi-taskers without the risk of turning your face into an oil slick mid-day, switching to an oil-free <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">BB cream for acne-prone skin</a> is your best bet.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>When both temperatures our skin’s oil production reaches their peak high, pores open up more, which can lead to <a href=# rel=noopener>exacerbated skin congestion</a>, blackheads, and even cystic breakouts. Opting for an oil-controlling and non-comedogenic formula is therefore increasingly important in the warmer months, so we’ve rounded up a few top-rated formulas that are also super wallet-friendly to boot.</p><p>These humidity-proof options are also great for those who prefer a <a href=# rel=noopener>higher-coverage foundation look</a> with a satin or matte finish sans the heavy feeling. Since the heat, and outdoors, in general, can really amp up the risk of makeup looking cakey and breaking up around problem areas after a couple of hours of wear, opting for an oil-free formula with an extra matte finish can help to extend the life of your base as well.

Garnier SkinActive 5-in-1 BB Cream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/garnier-skin-active-bb-cream-amazon.jpg><p>This affordable BB cream has definitely earned my personal seal of approval. I’ve actually used this product for years, and I prefer it over any of the other drugstore and high-end <a href=# id=auto-tag_bb-creams data-tag=bb-creams>BB creams</a> I’ve tried thus far — and I’ve tried a lot. It keeps oil at bay all day long, and the coverage is pretty solid — it can totally be built up to full. It also feels super lightweight and comfortable on the skin, which is a huge plus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bN4h4rAJL._SL500_.jpg><h2>2. Covergirl Clean Matte BB Cream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/covergirl-clean-matte-bb-cream-amazon.jpg><p>This is another one of my favorite affordable BB creams for oily and breakout-prone skin. While it’s marketed as a BB cream, it’s level of coverage rivals full coverage foundations without feeling heavy or looking cakey. It also has incredible staying power. I tend to get oily mid-day with most foundations (especially BB and CC creams) and I rarely have to touch-up throughout the day when I use this one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31wMf+rYoaL._SL500_.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$7.28</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$9.99</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>27% Off</span></p><h2>3. Physician’s Formula Organic Wear CC Cream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/physcians-formula-cc-cream-amazon.jpg><p>This affordable CC cream has buildable coverage that offers a slight glow without looking oily or clogging pores. The one downside to this product is its limited shade range. However, thanks to its sheer coverage, the color is slightly adjustable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31DAjrEkG8L._SL500_.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2hpYGaAdIOTaJmeq6Rir6N5wqucmqWjYq6kusRmmKaZqqS7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
