Dave is a multi-award-winning stand-up comedian best known for his satirical comedy sketch series, Chappelle’s Show. However, he quit the comedy series while the third season was in production.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from stand-up comedy, he has appeared in several films and had his first lead role in the 1998 comedy film “Half Baked.” He has also released six stand-up specials with Netflix under a $20 million per release deal. His lengthy career has seen him receive numerous awards, including six Emmy Awards, four Grammy Awards, and the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-18_07-10-54-fotor-2023061871522.jpg><p>Like most celebrity kids, Sulayman Chappelle rode on his father’s wings to fame. Despite being the child of a celebrity, he keeps most details about himself private. Hence, fans are curious about what the celebrity child has been up to since birth.</p><p>Here are five facts about him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=1_Sulayman_Chappelle_Is_the_First_Child_of_Dave_Chappelle></span>1. Sulayman Chappelle Is the First Child of Dave Chappelle<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dave Chappelle and his wife, Elaine Mendoza Erfe, tied the knot in 2001 after dating for several years. The pair welcomed their first child and son, Sulayman, in 2001 in Ohio, United States. Despite being the first child of a famous stand-up comedian, he has not revealed his exact birthdate.&nbsp;</p><p>Dave’s kids have unique names, and the inspiration behind them is pretty simple, he practices Islam. He converted to Islam in 1991, so he named them accordingly. In Sulayman’s case, his name means Solomon when translated from Arabic to Hebrew. In Hebrew, his name means “Man of Peace.”</p><p>His parents have also done a good job keeping his details away from the media’s scrutiny. As a result, there is little information regarding his early life and educational achievements. However, considering his rich family background, he has a good education. Like his father, he has a rich mixed cultural heritage. Sulayman is of African-American descent, with a part-Filipino ancestry through his mother’s side.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-18_07-10-49-fotor-2023061871433.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=2_He_Is_Training_to_Become_a_Professional_Boxer></span>2.

According to reports, Sulayman Chappelle has shown great interest in boxing and has been practicing since high school. To support the young star’s passion, his father had his friend mentor him.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, Sulayman was mentored by Freddie Roach, who happens to be one of the best boxing trainers on the field. With the dream of becoming a professional boxer someday, he began training at Manny Pacquiao’s Boxing Gym.

Like his elder brother, he has a unique name, “father of many” in Hebrew. Like his father, Ibrahim seems to love comedy. His father once joked about how he had to sit through a Kevin Hart show because of him.&nbsp;</p><p>Next is Sanaa Chappelle, Dave’s third and youngest child. She was born in 2009 and has shown interest in acting.

The budding star does not have an account on any social media platform. However, his father has many followers across his social media pages. Dave has 3 million followers on his Instagram page and over 1 million followers on his Twitter page.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-18_07-11-11-fotor-2023061871549.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=5_Sulayman_Chappelle_Does_Not_Have_a_Net_Worth></span>5.
