Firstly a TikTok trend for applying warm milk to the face has been doing the rounds this summer, following a clip by user @azian_beauti19, which has been played over 382,000 times. The trend is inspired by the beauty habits of Korean celebrities, who claim milk can treat breakouts, brighten and clarify, when applied as the first step of your skincare routine. Not only that, this year has played host to a raft of new beauty products based around hydrating, exfoliating and cleansing with milk-inspired formulas for face, hair and body. But while Cleopatra is said to have favoured sour donkey milk, enjoying the exfoliating benefits of its naturally-occurring lactic acid, today’s new innovations are considerably more palatable.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yes, just as many of us have swapped the cow’s milk in our coffee for oat, almond or soy alternatives, skincare is doing the same, utilising the nourishing benefits of plant-based milks. Take Dermalogica’s Daily Milkfoliant, a calming powder exfoliant with coconut milk and ground oat, which activates on contact with water to create a milky foam that helps to polish away dead cells without drying the skin. Or Fresh’s Milk Body Collection, a plant-based revival of a dairy-infused line that the brand originally launched in 1996. The 2022 iteration – which comprises a hand cream, body cleanser and body lotion – features vegan-friendly linseed, rice and centella milks instead, to nourish and hydrate as well as providing a decadent sensorial experience.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Fresh was the first brand to pioneer the use of milk in body care back in 1996 and I took inspiration directly from Cleopatra,” says the brand’s co-founder Lev Glazman. “At Fresh, we travel the world to discover and source the best natural ingredients for our products, but we are also constantly looking at how those ingredients can be improved upon. Our new plant-based milks – linseed, rice and centella – were all selected for their known soothing, nourishing and hydrating properties. Combining these milks with skin-softening ingredients like hyaluronic acid, vitamin E and niacinamide helps skin feel ultra-soft and conditioned.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Goop’s GoopGlow Dark Spot Exfoliating Sleep Milk uses oat beta-glucan, and a “desert milk” made from Kalahari melon, jojoba, and aloe, exfoliating whilst simultaneously hydrating with both glycolic and lactic acids (the latter being the OG exfoliator beloved by Cleopatra). And it’s not just skincare that is wising up to milk’s perks. Sol de Janeiro’s Brazilian Joia Milky Leave-In Conditioner treats hair to a nourishing blend of Brazil nut, cupuaçu and babaçu, a hydrating combination that leaves previously dry hair quenched and silky smooth.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s something about the texture of milk-inspired formulas that feels so good too. Summer Fridays’s ShadeDrops Mineral Milk Sunscreen has such a lightweight, milky texture that it sinks immediately into skin and provides a great base for make-up, while Violette FR’s Boum-Boum Milk is a toner, serum and moisturiser in one, packed with probiotics and providing an instant veil of moisture when spritzed onto the skin in all its milky glory. Both work well for layering with other products, avoiding the sticky feeling that can come with richer formulas. Highr Collective’s California Lip Milk brings gentle hydration to lips, combining it with a soft gloss finish thanks to a blend of sunflower oil and meadowfoam. And – a brand always with its finger on the pulse of what we all want now – Fenty Skin has just launched its Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence, a toner-essence formula with hyaluronic acid, tamarind, panthenol, niacinamide and more, to kickstart your routine with a healthy dose of plant-based nourishment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Whatever your skin type, the future is looking milky.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for #SkinSchool: How to do an at-home facial" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/thumbnail-skin-school-facial-1585065638.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX6i4qrrCmqmeZ5FpfnKCk3BtcGednrmsecGaqp6cXZeyosHTsmSpqp%2BZwqTA0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
