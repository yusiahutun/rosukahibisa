Memorably, Daenerys had a short-lived but fiery romance with Jon Snow, who, as the Season 7 finale of Game of Thrones revealed, turned out to be the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, a.k.a. Daenerys's older brother, making them the latest aunt-nephew couple to join their ancestry's long tradition of incestuous relationships.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But, how are they both connected to their House of the Dragon predecessors?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Technically, Rhaenyra is Daenerys's sixth great grandmother and Jon's seventh great grandmother.
