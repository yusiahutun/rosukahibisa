The fairytale-worthy frock was a fitting match for their Tuscan nuptials, but it turns out, that wasn’t the only white dress Upton wore that evening.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Later that night, she changed into a sexy, daring, and most importantly, sheer gown for the reception. The “naked dress” seemed fit for the red carpet, but Upton made it seem natural for a wedding afterparty. After all, she did co-design the number with Christy Rilling Studio (who also made her bridesmaids and flower girl dresses).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The boundary-pushing dress was covered in beads and pearls and included a draped cross-body strap and thigh-high slit. In other words, it covered all the bases for a sultry look. Though she had her locks down in shoulder-length curls during the day, Upton wore her hair up in an artistic knot for the night. She even incorporated some pearls into her updo to tie it back to the dress.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The “late night look” seemed delicate due to its intricate makeup, but the bride had no problem slicing cake, mingling with guests, and busting a move in the gown.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The model's afterparty snaps were just the latest in her streak of wedding photos on Instagram, which she kicked off last week. Even four months after tying the knot, how could she resist sharing them all, with a ceremony this beautiful?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Upton and Verlander exchanged vows at the Rosewood Castiglion del Bosco, a scenic luxury hotel in the countryside of Tuscany, Italy. The decor was romantic and rustic, from the flower scheme to the table setting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple got engaged in 2016, and Upton first announced the news and revealed her shining Anito Ko ring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/models/news/a15460/kate-upton-engaged/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="at the Met Gala" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">at the Met Gala</a> that year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm really excited, he asked me right before season started so we've been keeping it on the down low for quite a while...I'm excited to finally be able to share it with the world!" she gushed to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.eonline.com/news/761495/kate-upton-is-engaged-to-justin-verlander-shows-off-huge-ring-at-2016-met-gala data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="E!
