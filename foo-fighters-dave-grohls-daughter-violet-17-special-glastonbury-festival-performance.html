Dave told the crowds as they launched directly into 'All My Life,' for their short hour-long set. "We only have one hour, so we’re going to try and fit in as many songs as we can," he said, before joking: "You guys knew it was us this whole time. You knew it was us, right?"&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7ad11f4af143-davegrohl-daughter-violet-glato.jpg><p id=eHdVaPiXWf data-wc=29>2023 marks the band's 25th anniversary of the first time they played the British festival; in 1998 they played on the same day and in the same time slot.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZ6V2bfqFY data-wc=29>The performance was also their <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>first in the UK since they returned to the stage on May 26&nbsp;</a>and were joined by late drummer Taylor Hawkins' 17-year-old son Shane.&nbsp;</p><p id=ey0MJKhkkO data-wc=34>"How about we do a song with one of my favorite drummers in the world?

Taking to the band's official Twitter account, they wrote: "The Foo Fighters family is devastated by the tragic and untimely loss of our beloved Taylor Hawkins. His musical spirit and infectious laughter will live on with all of us forever. Our hearts go out to his wife, children and family, and we ask that their privacy be treated with the utmost respect in this unimaginably difficult time."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dYWVa21pZ5akvG6yyKCfrZ2iqHqlrdWeZKCqn525tHnDmqygoKSav27CyKijnqxdZoRuv8%2BemqKZnGK0ra3SraanmqWnxm6yxKyroq6RoXqxsdGfpqulkaOwpns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
