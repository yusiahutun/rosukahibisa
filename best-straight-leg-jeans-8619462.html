They’re the endlessly cool, old faithful essentials that we live our lives in — so it’s of the utmost importance that they’re just right. In the ever-shifting landscape of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>denim trends</a>, straight-leg jeans are, unwaveringly, the gold standard. The clean, timeless silhouette is the tried and truest blue of all denim styles, having been a signifier of effortless cool since the 1950s when they were etched into the collective heart by stars like James Dean and sitting squarely in the center of the swinging denim zeitgeist pendulum ever since.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Straight-leg jeans are the sturdiest foundation and smoothest canvas for an outfit. Finding a perfect pair is an unparalleled feeling — so whether you’re looking for jeans that’ll work for the office, are ready to welcome warm weather with crisp whites, or are searching for pristine dark wash, selvage raw denim that’s imbued with a hint of shimmer, we’ve selected the best pairs for every pallet. We also consulted with the award-winning stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Tara West</a>, celebrity stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Jen Rade</a>, size-inclusive blogger and stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>Chloe Xandria</a>, and stylist and creative consultant <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nocaes>Christine Nicholson</a> about how to wear them.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-agolde-90s-pinch-waist-high-waist-straight-long></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Agolde ‘90s Pinch Waist High Waist Straight Long</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Agolde &amp;acirc;90s Pinch Waist High Waist Straight Long" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VU_2W5B5VlwxhNlvimMEfCWkHag=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Agolde-90s-Pinch-Waist-High-Waist-Straight-Long-e2d68c3c40304775ac2cde72255c5fa5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Agolde</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The simplicity!

The pinch waist is designed to compliment the body, the inseam is full-length without running too long, and they’re reasonably priced.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton | <strong>Size:</strong> 22–34 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 32 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-affordable-banana-republic-the-ranger-straight-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Affordable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Banana Republic The Ranger Straight Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Banana Republic The Ranger Straight Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/feXtTuO2vIMEd4oiaw8S8__UJsE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Banana-Republic-The-Ranger-Straight-Jean-87341a9c8ce545608088e4a77f83250d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Banana Republic</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The quality and details exceed the price point. We love, for example, that they’re made with reinforced front panels that create a discreet, vintage-inspired side stripe.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> the reinforced front panel construction and side stripe may not be for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At $60 on sale, these jeans are an absolute steal. They’re vintage and workwear-inspired, so they have a bit of a tough, utilitarian feel to them — while still looking sleek and polished. They’re lengthening and comprised of high-quality, durable denim sourced from the family-run, sustainably-minded Candiani Mill in Italy. (Banana Republic has semi-recently revamped its denim program, and these do not read as very budget-friendly.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Rade, straight-leg jeans need to have “A good fit on the waist and hip. The length can always be changed, but be sure to have the original hem put back on! Most dry cleaners have a tailor that can do this for around $25.” Although these are our budget-friendly pick, they’re tailored well to the waist and hip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton | <strong>Size:</strong> 24–35 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 27, 29, or 32 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-khaite-albi-high-rise-straight-leg-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Khaite Albi High-Rise Straight-Leg Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Net-a-Porter Khaite Albi High-Rise Straight-Leg Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_cJYZyhfFdUqs-uM0kzMqNyN2To=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Khaite-Albi-High-Rise-Straight-Leg-Jeans-8d9aab612b944fd58ca2e2d404e987ca.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Net-a-Porter</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The attention to impeccable fit (especially around the hips) and detail make these jeans worth the hype and cost. We also appreciate that they’re made in Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They’re lengthy jeans, so if you plan to wear them with sneakers or flats, you may need to have them shortened a bit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a reason that Khaite jeans have a devoted cult following. The Albi jeans are expertly crafted with a high-rise and long inseam that runs along the stovepipe silhouette, so they’re designed to visually elongate the legs. Khaite jeans are all hand-finished (which makes a huge difference) and every-so-slightly distressed, so the fading looks completely natural. Life is all about the details, so we appreciate the brassy gold threading, wide belt loops, quiet whiskering, and lack of a logo tag on the back pocket.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton | <strong>Size:</strong> 24–32 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 29.9 inches</p><p><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> Most retailers note that they run true to size, however, having watched too many Khaite jeans try-on TikToks, we’ve learned that most people tend to size up when selecting Khaite jeans.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-madewell-petite-90s-straight-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Petite</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Petite '90s Straight Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell Petite '90s Straight Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ly1RYemGkYJ0v0cKxNPQfs8oO5I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Madewell-Petite-90s-Straight-Jean-91b2b91fb4b949598cc4e3ce4b42b3aa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> As a part of their sustainability efforts, Madewell has a trade-in program, so for each pair of jeans (from any brand) that you bring into or ship to their stores, you’ll get $20 off of a new pair of Madewell jeans.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> We wish that there was a dark blue wash available.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These ’90s-inspired, semi-relaxed jeans are thoughtfully composed with a lengthening, un-cropped leg, a high-rise, and a semi-snug fit at the thighs. They look as though they could be vintage — and when it comes to denim, that’s a high compliment. They’re designed to flatter petite frames — Madewell’s line of petite denim comes recommended to those who are 5 feet, 3 inches tall and under — and don’t look disproportionate or especially short.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, Lycra | <strong>Size:</strong> 23–33 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 28 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tall-reformation-cynthia-high-rise-straight-long-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Cynthia High Rise Straight Long Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Cynthia High Rise Straight Long Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/j4quUUrvMcCPkfvbfygeJLvFNuA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Cynthia-High-Rise-Straight-Long-Jeans-cdfe499ab39543788b9ab440e52b258e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The cotton is regeneratively grown and we appreciate that Reformation can alter your jeans at no cost.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> According to reviews, the sizing is inconsistent.

The waist and elongated lines of these jeans are perfectly proportionate. They’re truly straight, have a generous 33-inch inseam, are nicely snug at the hips and thighs, and leave enough room at the bottom to work well with ankle boots. “You want to go for the rise and length that fits your body type best,” says Nicholson, and these jeans are built to compliment — not just suit — tall frames.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Regeneratively-grown cotton, Tencel lyocell | <strong>Size:</strong> 23–34 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 33 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-universal-standard-donna-high-rise-curve-straight-leg-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Universal Standard Donna High-Rise Curve Straight Leg Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Universal Standard Donna High-Rise Curve Straight Leg Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/W4_3m9PXTcXc9fW1xunPmu8iLZU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Universal-Standard-Donna-High-Rise-Curve-Straight-Leg-Jeans-b76daf0bc8a94468b6096ca098154f3d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Universal Standard</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> They’re made to be incredibly comfortable and have deep pockets.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The sizing is a bit confusing, as they run true-to-generous.

They’re designed with total comfort in mind for those with a 10-inch waist-to-hip difference. They have stretch to them, hug ever so slightly at the hips, and are available with a regular or tall inseam.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Xandria, it’s essential to know which brands and styles work for you and your body type. “Abercrombie, On 34th, Good American, and Anthropologie also have excellent plus-size denim options,” she says, encouraging a focus on fit rather than size, as size can vary greatly from brand to brand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester, rayon, elastane | <strong>Size:</strong> 00–40 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 27 and 32 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-7-for-all-mankind-bair-kimmie-straight-in-rinsed-black></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>7 For All Mankind B(air) Kimmie Straight in Rinsed Black</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="7 For All Mankind B(air) Kimmie Straight in Rinsed Black" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9qoHqxKyur1jGuGOR4rqcu3ddyM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/7-for-all-mankind-bair-kimmie-straight-in-rinsed-black-ad1a81e99f7d43a5b618bdc7211a790e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>7 For All Mankind</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> We love the black hardware, which gives the jeans a monochromatic, discreet finish.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Not to nitpick, but the label on the back right pocket stands out against the black wash.

They’re perfect for evenings, at a concert, or on a typical date night, in addition to days at the office. This soft and comfortable pair by 7 For All Mankind is simple but chic (and therefore very versatile), tailored with a slimmer cut and void of unnecessary details. They’d work well with a slightly oversized top like a button-down, a roomy cashmere cardigan, or a boxy T-shirt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, lyocell, polyester, viscose, spandex | <strong>Size:</strong> 23–34 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 32 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-white-toteme-classic-cut-denim-full-length-off-white></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best White</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Toteme Classic Cut Denim Full-Length Off-White</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TOTEME Classic Cut Denim Full-Length Off-White" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zaKwQR5aezh9EJdXsTHQEhelLzk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/TOTEME-Classic-Cut-Denim-Full-Length-Off-White-6b9d6648b491475484c2052f47a37768.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>TOTEME</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The attention to detail, from the off-white coloring to the monochromatic leather back pocket tag to the discreet hardware, sets these cream-colored jeans apart from others.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> They’re on the pricier side, especially because most of us gravitate towards wearing blue jeans more frequently than white.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">White jeans are nothing new — they first appeared on the denim scene and became popular in the 1960s — and yet they perpetually read as a gust of fresh, clean air. This pair, made in Italy from organic, vintage-white cotton, is beautifully tailored for a relaxed fit and punctuated with super subtle silver hardware — which can be challenging to find on white jeans. If you find white jeans to be intimidating, consider trying a monochromatic, bright look: white jeans, a white cotton crew-neck T-shirt, and neutral-hued sandals.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton | <strong>Size:</strong> 23–32 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 28, 30, 32, and 34 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-agolde-harper-straight-jean-stretch></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Comfortable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Agolde Harper Straight Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Agolde Harper Straight Jean (Stretch)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Lhu6AKDtw_lyfqMOyAf_Z53oMjQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Agolde-Harper-Straight-Jean-Stretch-0e346f39f2de4d5b8499c2ca1dd59ca3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Agolde</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> When you buy from Agolde, you have the option to round up for the charity of your choice: Girls, Inc., Doctors Without Borders, or United States Association for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> All stretchy jeans, stretch, which can be frustrating when a pair that fits perfectly upon purchase becomes too big after a couple of wears.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Harper Straight checks all of the boxes that make for a super comfortable pair of jeans: a loose-but-not-too-baggy fit, a great capacity to stretch, a soft, organic cotton and elastane composure, a zip fly (which we find to be much more comfortable than button flies), and an easy, medium-rise. Because they have stretch to them, they’ll become even more comfortable with every wear.

You want the jeans to look and feel like you’ve worn them relentlessly for years, and that they’re now looking better than ever despite being held together by visible threads. The Seroya Romas look as though they were previously owned by a skater boy — in the best way possible.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Roma is available in just this wash — which is great if you’re seeking jeans with a super faded, vintage feel, but doesn’t leave options. Also, the outer seam features frayed piping, which can be divisive.

Opt for a high-rise for an elevated look and a mid or low-rise for a relaxed, off-duty look,” says West. Cuffed jeans can be tricky — they’re often too cropped, too tight at the ankle, or read as being gimmicky. In an ideal world, cuffed jeans would look like floor-grazing jeans that have simply been creased and turned up at the hem. This pair is full-length with a semi-relaxed fit and a high rise, so they fit the bill.

Raw denim is a great option because it’s stiff and infused with a subtle sheen. This pair reads as being semi-formal, while still radiating the beloved aura of denim. If you’re wearing jeans to work, keep the rest of your look more traditionally professional with a sharp white button-down or simple blouse, a structured blazer, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>loafers</a> or kitten heels, and a sleek barrette.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of sizing, this style runs large, according to the brand.

If you’re only going to wear them sporadically, know that they won’t feel as comfortable as other pairs right off the bat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Organic cotton | <strong>Size:</strong> 23–32 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 34 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wild-card-zara-zw-collection-straight-cut-mid-rise-rhinestone-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wild Card</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Zara Straight Cut Mid Rise Rhinestone Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Zara ZW Collection Straight Cut Mid Rise Rhinestone Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2QoAtKZ51YtZPb7Ed-SyFqo57zo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Zara-ZW-Collection-Straight-Cut-Mid-Rise-Rhinestone-Jeans-ac10f0fd373a49c1950a9905a4eff144.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Zara</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> We love the commitment to the bit, as embellished jeans are rarely covered from top to bottom. These jeans are a playful, gleaming treat — for only $109.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Decorated jeans tend to not be as comfortable as others.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your daily uniform is denim-centric, it’s great to have a wild card pair on hand. The differentiating factors may be cutouts, patchwork, decals, jewel or stud detailing, a colorful wash, leather lacing, or embroidery. This pair from Zara looks as though it’s covered in dark raindrops or sparkling specimens from a different hemisphere. We love that the rhinestones are low contrast and cover every inch. Because ornate jeans can be quite eye-catching, they’re best when paired with simple pieces — think a cardigan worn as a shirt, a tank top, or a solid crew-neck T-shirt and neutral-toned ballet flats.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From a care perspective, we don’t expect that these jeans will be as easy as a plain pair to clean and maintain. Surprisingly, however, they don’t require dry cleaning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, rhinestones | <strong>Size:</strong> 25–32 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> Not listed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Wash:</strong> The wash of your jeans — which can range from pure white to streaky light blue to mid-tones to indigo to jet black — plays a major role. Washed, faded, and distressed jeans are great for daytime. The darker the wash, the more sleek and dressy the pair of jeans will look. All white, blue, and black denim is considered to be neutral in tone, and can therefore be paired with any color.</li><li><strong>Rise: </strong>The rise determines how a pair of jeans will fit and sit on your body. If you prefer a more structured look or have a petite frame, high-rise jeans are a great, lengthening option. Mid-rise jeans are the most universal, and are also the easiest to style. Low-rise jeans are ideal for those who have an athletic build and/or those who don’t necessarily want to emphasize their waist and for taller frames. With all of this being said, the rise is a matter of personal preference and every rise can work for everyone. The rise also plays a role in the vibe of the jeans: low-rise denim is very Y2K-inspired and looks laid back, while high-rise jeans look more traditional and structured, and mid-rise jeans are neutral.</li><li><strong>Rigidness: </strong>We love both stretchy and rigid jeans, but there are pros and cons to each. Stretchy jeans tend to be extremely comfortable, but they can lose their shape in the washing machine and dryer, and can also stretch out as time goes on. As Xandria says, the former is better for those who experience frequent bloating and weight fluctuations. Rigid jeans, on the other hand, take a while to break in and will never feel as flexible as stretchy jeans, but they retain their structure and form over time. If you prefer super rigid styles, go for thicker or raw denim, which will retain its form for much longer. As far as looks go, stretchier jeans can come across as being casual, while rigid jeans are more classic.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Which shoes look best with straight-leg jeans?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Straight-leg jeans work beautifully with nearly every style of shoe. During cooler seasons, channel ’90s minimalism by wearing straight-leg jeans with sleek leather pointed-toe ankle boots. The rest of the year, they go especially well with ballet flats, kitten heels, simple flat sandals, stilettos, loafers, classic sneakers like original high-top Converse and Adidas Sambas, ’70s-inspired wedges, platforms, and clogs.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How should I style straight-leg jeans?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Part of the unending appeal of straight-leg jeans is their versatility. Nothing beats a black or white solid crew neck T-shirt worn with straight-leg jeans. Similarly, though, a striped Breton or a white, oversized button-down and jeans are as timeless as it gets. For work, consider wearing a dark, undistressed pair with a sweater or blouse, a tailored blazer, and loafers. West especially loves pairing them with “A blazer or a bodysuit,” and says that “a cropped cashmere sweater looks beautiful with a high-waisted pair.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for styling tricks, wearing a belt with your jeans will automatically make any look more polished. Rade notes that “It's important to choose tops that can be tucked [or half-tucked in the front so that you can] see the waist and have shape and definition. Or [wear] a fitted top. Proportion is everything.” West echoes this, confirming that one should be “Be mindful of proportions…You want to have some definition in your waistline.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can straight-leg jeans work for every body type?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In a word, absolutely. Straight-leg jeans are as universally complimentary as they are timeless. When you’re shopping for the right pair(s) for you, make sure to pay attention to factors that affect the fit: inseam, stretch factor, rise, and how much they hug the hips. There’s a lot of variety under the umbrella of straight jeans, from lengthy slim-cut stovepipes to relaxed, slouchier cuts — so there’s a perfect fit for everybody.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Also, remember that most garments — even jeans — look best when tailored. Nicholson emphasizes the importance of paying attention to fit, noting that, “Denim is the one clothing item that should always be tailored to your body type.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can I wear straight-leg jeans to dressier events?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our experts approve of straight-leg jeans for more formal occasions; it’s just a matter of how they’re styled. “Throw on a tuxedo jacket, a silky blouse, and heels…For anything more formal, choose denim in a dark, clean wash. Save the distressed jeans for daytime,” says Rade. West agrees with this outfit formula but is partial to a cropped blazer or jacket. (Considering proportions are particularly important when styling high-waisted jeans.) “Add a chic earring and a clutch,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nicholson agrees, too, cementing the power of formal jeans. “It really speaks to the versatility of this particular cut of denim,” she says, “We’ve seen so many chic moments during the ’80s, ’90s, and beyond of people wearing a straight-leg jean with everything from Chanel tweed jackets paired with the perfect jewelry to really fanciful blouses and even more classic looks consisting of a pressed dress shirt and a blazer.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Alexandra Malmed is a contributing writer with more than twelve years of fashion writing experience for publications including Vogue, Man Repeller, Byrdie, and Coveteur.
