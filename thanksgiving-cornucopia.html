A frequent presence in Greek and Roman folklore, the overflowing cornucopia was often depicted as a symbolic accessory carried by gods and goddesses like Hercules, Fortuna, and Demeter. It was first described as an actual animal "horn" taken from Amalthea, the goat nurse of Zeus. According to the ancient Greeks, baby Zeus was being cared for and fed by Amalthea when he broke off one of her horns, which began to emit a constant supply of food for him. That's how this "horn of plenty" first came to symbolize prosperity, wealth, and abundance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-text css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The pagan symbol was later adopted by Christians and used often in European harvest festivals to celebrate lush, bountiful crops. It was also used on currencies, coats of arms, and in church decorations.</p><img alt="overflowing thanksgiving cornucopia symbolism" title="Overflowing Thanksgiving Cornucopia Symbolism" width=2121 height=1414 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/autumn-thanksgiving-cornucopia-overflowing-1565106220.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span></p><h2 title="Why is the cornucopia a symbol of Thanksgiving? And was there a cornucopia at the first Thanksgiving?" data-anchor-id=why-is-the-cornucopia-a-symbol-of-thanksgiving-and-was-there-a-cornucopia-at-the-first-thanksgiving class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 eqwrocx1">Why is the cornucopia a symbol of Thanksgiving? And was there a cornucopia at the first Thanksgiving?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Thanksgiving has always been an ode to harvest time, and it's always taken place in the fall—so it's natural that the holiday would feature the cornucopia, which historically embodies those things. Beyond that hypothesis though, it's unknown when or why the cornucopia became associated with the American holiday. Historians have long surmised that it may have been a nod back to those European harvest festivals, but that must have happened sometime after the first Thanksgiving. There's no formal record of a cornucopia appearing there.</p><h2 title="What is the purpose of a cornucopia? " data-anchor-id=what-is-the-purpose-of-a-cornucopia class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 eqwrocx1">What is the purpose of a cornucopia?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Today, the cornucopia is used purely for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/entertaining/g1371/thanksgiving-decorations/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Thanksgiving decorations" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Thanksgiving decorations</a>. It continues to symbolize abundance, a bountiful harvest, and, by extension, an appreciation for both of those things. It makes sense, then, that Americans today still use the decorations as centerpieces for their <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/entertaining/g634/thanksgiving-table-settings-1108/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Thanksgiving table" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Thanksgiving table</a>. They're also widely used in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/diy-crafts/g22626432/thanksgiving-crafts-for-kids/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="children's crafts" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">children's crafts</a>.</p><h2 title="How do you fill a cornucopia—and where should you display it?" data-anchor-id=how-do-you-fill-a-cornucopiaand-where-should-you-display-it class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 eqwrocx1">How do you fill a cornucopia—and where should you display it?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">You might want to start by putting something in it. Just about anything and everything can be placed in a cornucopia, of course, but in the U.S., it's typically filled to the point of overflowing with a variety of fruits, veggies, grains, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/life/travel/g21273436/pumpkin-farms-near-me/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=pumpkins class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">pumpkins</a>, all of which share a color scheme or are specific to the autumn season. As for where to put it, the possibilities are endless: Place the filled cornucopia in the center of your Thanksgiving table for a lush-looking centerpiece, add it to a kitchen counter or island for a splash of festive charm all season long, or even display it on a bureau or other tabletop surface anywhere in your home.</p><h2 title="How should you style a cornucopia?" data-anchor-id=how-should-you-style-a-cornucopia class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 eqwrocx1">How should you style a cornucopia?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">There are no rules when it comes to styling cornucopias. But we're partial to an organic, relaxed vibe—and a cornucopia that's brimming with fresh produce is an easy way to get there. Instead of arranging your gourds in a carefully considered pattern or ensuring that they're placed just so, allow them to spill out of the inner cavern and onto your table for a look that's as effortless and natural as it is beautiful.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Of course, you don't have to stick to mini pumpkins and squash. Try adding succulents to your cornucopias as demonstrated in the above video. Or, play around with fresh flowers and wrapped candies. If the cornucopia will be displayed at a kids' table, you could even add some small trinkets or toys for the little ones.
