Jossie Merrifield's parents are Joe Merrifield and Eileen, but her father <a id=https://www.themidwestcrimefiles.com/post/the-merrifield-sisters href=# rel="nofollow noopener">died in 2014</a>. The details of her mother remain a mystery. Jossie grew up alongside an older sister, Sandra Merrifield, four years older.</p><p class=align-left>Josie and Sandy, as their loved ones knew them, were part of a blended family and had several step-siblings. Unfortunately, the Merrifield sisters were victims of abuse from their father, who raised them in strict conditions. Jossie was a student at Collinsville High School.</p><h2>Jossie Merrifield's children</h2><p class=align-left>Jossie conceived her firstborn son at 16 years old. Unfortunately, no one knew about the whereabouts of the baby's father. In addition, her sister Sandra was jealous that her younger sister had become a mother before her. Sandy worked as a <a href=#>nursing</a> assistant and lived with her boyfriend, Everette. The couple reportedly tried to have a baby, but she suffered several miscarriages.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4482e9cb8169f2f6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sylvia Likens murder: What really happened and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 1997, Jossie's firstborn son, Jordan, was born. The teenage mother raised her son in her parents' house. However, she longed to have a man in her life. Not long afterwards, Josie met Chester Marshall at a local joint. The two connected instantly and got into a romantic relationship.</p><h3>Jossie Merrifield's son Jasper</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/217d70455ed12fe4.png><p class=align-left>In 1998, Josie conceived her second child. She shared the news with her sister, who was displeased and asked her younger sister to let her raise the baby. Initially, Josie embraced the idea but later changed her mind after discussing the matter with Chester, her baby's father. Unfortunately, her sister's decision did not go down well with Sandra.</p><p class=align-left>However, the two sisters started spending more time in Sandy's <a href=#>house</a>. After a few weeks, Sandra announced that she was also pregnant. The two were excited and spent a lot of time together sharing the details of their pregnancy journies.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5a67baaad7e22041.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jodie Fletcher: Photos and quick facts about Terrell Fletcher's daughter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Eventually, Chester Marshall and Jossie Merrifield got a bouncing baby boy, Jasper, on August 11, 1999, at the Anderson Hospital in Maryville. She was discharged the following day, and Sandra visited them, helped them pack their bags and took them for a drive.</p><h2>What happened to Jossie Merrifield?</h2><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, after the drive with her sister, Jossie was never seen again, and Sandra went home with her sister's children. When her boyfriend arrived home later that evening, she told him that she had experienced pains earlier and visited her doctor. She claimed to have given birth in his office.</p><p class=align-left>When asked about Jossie's firstborn son, she said his mother had gone out with Marshall. He believed his girlfriend and went to buy some items for their newborn. However, the tables turned when Everette started receiving reports that Jossie was missing.</p><p class=align-left>He rushed home and confronted Sandy about her sister and the baby before leading her to Collinsville Police. Sandra led the local authorities to a ravine south of Collinsville, where they found Jossie's dead body lying face down in the water.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e36a0222e77313e5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tawny Kitaen bio: Net worth, children, husband, now and then</span></p></a><p class=align-left>According to Sandy, the sisters were arguing about the newborn's father. Sandy suspected that her sister had an affair with her boyfriend. She said they left the <a href=#>vehicle</a>, and she passed out after that. Sandra woke up after a few minutes to find a bloody rock in her hand and her sister lying in the ravine. However, the autopsy report stated the cause of death as drowning.</p><h2>So, where is Sandra Merrifield today?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4482e9cb8169f2f6.jpg><p class=align-left>The police continued to investigate Sandra, and she disclosed that she had lied about being pregnant. At first, she lied that she had delivered a stillbirth and threw the baby into Horseshoe Lake. Authorities searched the water body but did not find any remains, concluding that the murder was premeditated.</p><p class=align-left>Sandra was charged with first-degree murder but pleaded to second-degree murder in 2001. A psychologist consulted by the defence diagnosed Jossie's sister with post-partum psychosis and dissociative states resulting from child abuse.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ec98272d5bba4e3f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Thandie Newton: Ethnic background, husband, daughter, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Sandra was sentenced to <a id=https://thecinemaholic.com/jossie-merrifield-murder-where-is-sandra-merrifield-now/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">18 years</a> in prison but only served seven with credit for time served.
