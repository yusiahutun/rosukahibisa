While paparazzi managed to get images of Swift coming and going from her party —&nbsp;which featured stars like Blake Lively and Zoë Kravitz —&nbsp;it was her friends (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>and the songstress herself</a>) who offered a peek at what happened inside behind closed doors.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Can’t believe this year … actually … happened? Thank you for all your beautiful birthday wishes yesterday," Swift wrote alongside a carousel of photos that included cameos from Gigi Hadid, Abigail Anderson, Jack Antonoff, Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams, Este Haim, Alana Haim, Antoni Porowski, and more.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>More in Celeb News</span></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zKKjnqtdqbKtuMSrZLChlpp6rLHLnqCgoF2ovaa%2B0bJkrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXae2r7OMcWtqcWVlfg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
