Puffiness can<strong> result from nearly a dozen different things</strong>: Sodium consumption, allergies, a lack of sleep, your diet, or even genetics, and often, puffiness<strong> appears alongside other common under-eye woes</strong>, like<strong> </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wrinkles</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>dark circles</a>, in addition to your<strong> </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>everyday under-eye dryness</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To be up to the task, a genuinely terrific eye cream for puffiness should be packed with ingredients that can tackle a variety of eye-area concerns. “You’ll want something <strong>hydrating, brightening, and supportive of collagen and elastin synthesis</strong>,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Dr. Deanne Robinson</a>, a Connecticut-based board-certified dermatologist and professor of dermatology at Yale School of Medicine.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Expecting one product to address a handful of concerns all at once is stressful, but <strong>InStyle editors </strong>were not going to let a sleepless night stand in the way of brighter, smoother under-eyes. And so, we tested the <strong>24 most popular eye creams for puffiness </strong>out there, integrating each cream into our morning and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>evening skincare routines</a> for <strong>four weeks</strong>. Collectively, we <strong>spent</strong> <strong>889 hours testing</strong>, judging each one for <strong>consistency and feel</strong>, <strong>absorption speed</strong>, and most importantly, <strong>the results it delivered both immediately and over time</strong>.<strong> </strong>After rigorous testing, we can<strong> </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>definitively declare</a><strong> </strong>that <strong>these eye creams for puffiness are the next best thing to a full night’s rest</strong>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-macrene-actives-high-performance-eye-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Macrene Actives High Performance Eye Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Macrene Actives High Performance Eye Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/U-ohuQcHBZl8dKH2aBDFrZI6Ru0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eyecream-95ddb7b83c56473a96bd136bd85fb97b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The lightweight cream felt cooling and nourishing, and it improved our puffiness and fine lines almost instantly.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>We didn’t see a huge improvement in our dark circles.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">An eye cream is nothing if it doesn't deliver results, but it's a unicorn if it does so quickly — which is exactly what this <strong>lightweight cream</strong> did. We were impressed not only by how <strong>quickly it sank into skin</strong>, leaving it <strong>hydrated</strong>, <strong>smooth</strong>, and <strong>soft</strong>, but also how it<strong> immediately minimized the puffiness </strong>under our eyes. Plus, the <strong>results had staying power</strong>, with a long-term improvement in our puffiness as well.</p><p>We also appreciated that the eye cream <strong>took care of the dry skin</strong> near our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eyelids</a> in a single application, and <strong>didn't feel irritating</strong> despite us having sensitivity around the eye area. Instead of using the included pearl spoon to apply the cream, we preferred to use it to deposit a small amount of the product on skin, then use our fingertips to tap it into skin until it absorbed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this eye cream <strong>did a great job</strong> at reducing puffiness, lax skin, and crows' feet around our eyes, it didn't work as well for our dark circles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Peptides, resveratrol, caffeine<strong>｜Usage</strong>: Apply it twice daily around the eyes｜<strong>Fragrance-Free</strong>: Yes<strong>｜Size</strong>: 0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-la-roche-posay-redermic-r-retinol-eye-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>La Roche-Posay Redermic R Retinol Eye Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="La Roche-Posay Redermic R Retinol Eye Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AsWhuF0BiJicoSy8V2fDPk3sQCc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/la-roche-posay-redermic-r-retinol-eye-cream-e5091c4d3f9949a6b7e56f748c8f80b3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: It contains retinol, a time-tested and science-backed ingredient to firm and smooth skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: We didn’t see results after a few weeks of use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Retinol is a go-to ingredient </strong>among dermatologists for its ability to <strong>speed up skin cell turnover </strong>and <strong>boost collagen production</strong>, so we had high hopes for this eye cream. We were happy to find that we only needed to use a small amount under each eye, and the gel-like cream <strong>felt light and hydrating</strong> on the skin — with <strong>zero burning or tingling</strong> despite having sensitivities under our eyes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We applied it only at night due to the gradual-release retinol, and after 20 minutes, our <strong>under-eye area felt noticeably softer</strong>. While we didn’t see an improvement in how puffy our eyes are, our eyes still looked more refreshed and youthful.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, we didn't notice any tightening or smoothing effect after three weeks of using it, but that kind of makes sense: Retinol can take some time to work, so we plan to stick with it and see if we notice even more improvements after a few more weeks of nightly use.</p><p><strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Retinol, caffeine, glycerin｜<strong>Usage</strong>: At night, apply and massage it from the inner corner of the eye outward｜<strong>Fragrance-Free</strong>: Yes｜<strong>Size</strong>: 0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-the-inkey-list-caffeine-eye-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Inkey List Caffeine Eye Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Inkey List Caffeine Eye Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FMXnHIBiQFvSRFYP_AC2i8GXLK8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/The-Inkey-List-Caffeine-Eye-Cream-6839e7f037dd4a76801e63eeed177aaa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: A little goes a long way, and it hydrates with a comfortable, cooling sensation.<br><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: It takes a long time of regular use to see results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Few brands offer potent ingredients with a <strong>gentle price tag </strong>quite like The Inkey List, and this formula is proof that, so long as you're game for a few trade-offs, you can tackle puffy under-eyes for roughly the same price as a weekday lunch. While the formula <strong>feels lightweight</strong>, we found that a little went a long way; just a dab covered both our under-eyes with extra to spare. It's <strong>infused with</strong> <strong>caffeine</strong>, which can help <strong>stimulate circulation</strong> and thus move stagnant fluids out from beneath the eyes, as well as a peptide that helps <strong>reduce the look of fine lines.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once the formula finally sank in, it really did work to decrease puffiness. Our under-eyes <strong>also</strong> <strong>seem to be tighter</strong>, <strong>firmer</strong>, and <strong>all-around less wrinkly</strong>. But most impressive was how <strong>well it hydrated</strong>; we wore it overnight and noticed that the skin of our under-eye area <strong>looked more hydrated and supple</strong> by morning. We also appreciated that it was gentle enough for everyday use; we used it twice a day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We did have to have some patience, since we didn't see any changes until the fourth week of using it — and it took about 10 minutes for it to sink in.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Albizia Julibrissin bark extract, caffeine, peptides｜<strong>Usage</strong>: Apply a pea-sized amount and gently pat it in with your ring finger｜<strong>Fragrance-Free</strong>: Yes｜<strong>Size</strong>: 0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-brightening-ilia-bright-start-retinol-alternative-eye-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Brightening</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ilia Retinol Alternative Eye Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ILIA Bright Start Retinol Alternative Brightening Eye Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/t91MBDvENRwXHsaFsGS3Wt0GXH0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ILIA-Bright-Start-Activated-Eye-Cream-c24621e694454ce4ba314231b6f7cf61.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: It feels hydrating and protective off the bat, and it layers nicely with other skincare products.<br><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: Because of the shimmer and tint, it’s best for morning use only.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to daytime eye creams, <strong>few are better than this formula</strong>. For one, we found that it <strong>brightens on the spot</strong>, thanks to the peachy tint and the subtle shimmer, which is enough to catch the light but not so much that it doubles as makeup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Contributing to its de-puffing abilities was the applicator: While some eye creams come with a scoop or spatula, this one has a <strong>ceramic-tipped applicator</strong>, which gave it a <strong>cooling sensation that we loved</strong>. It also helped the formula glide on nicely, so we only needed a pea-size amount to cover both under-eye areas. It has a silky finish that we found <strong>layered really nicely</strong> between other skincare products without pilling. But most of all, we liked the immediate brightening effect and slight depuffing effect it had on our skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, we noticed that the results, while they were<strong> immediate and visible</strong>, weren’t long-lasting beyond one full day, and we’d still wake up the next morning with puffy eyes. But since we <strong>loved the feel of the cooling applicator and hydrating cream so much</strong>, we would have continued to use it every morning regardless.</p><p><strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Sea fennel extract, avocado extract, caffeine｜<strong>Usage</strong>: Squeeze the tube to swipe a small amount under your eye, then use the cooling side of the ceramic tip to massage it in｜<strong>Fragrance-Free</strong>: Yes｜<strong>Size</strong>: 0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-puffiness-and-dryness-kiehls-creamy-eye-treatment-with-avocado></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Puffiness and Dryness</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kiehl’s Avocado Eye Treatment</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kiehl&amp;rsquo;s Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GkAHNghK3TB5dlfOOtqZeatlAYw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kiehls-Creamy-Eye-Treatment-with-Avocado-843027c6157e40c2bbea1c0ce3dc3aee.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: It surpassed all of our expectations, hydrating, smoothing, brightening, and de-puffing the eye area immediately.<br><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: It doesn’t have any sensorial features like a cooling sensation or added scent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like the fruit that inspired it, this <strong>eye cream is as thick and velvety</strong> as it gets — so much so that it felt more like an eye mask than an eye cream when we tried it. That said, despite its rich consistency, we found that it <strong>sank in immediately</strong> in small amounts, providing a <strong>ton of hydration</strong> and an<strong> indulgent feel</strong>. It also <strong>worked</strong> <strong>really nicely under our makeup</strong>, creating a smooth canvas and effectively <strong>acting like an eye makeup primer</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The results were impressive, especially the <strong>visible improvements</strong> in the appearance of our under-eye area on the <strong>very first day of using it</strong>. We also noticed that it tightened and firmed the skin beneath our eyes, too, giving us a more rejuvenated, youthful look (in fact, we could even feel a tightening sensation as soon as we applied it).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only drawback is that the price point is a little high, especially if you’re looking for the larger jar, but we think it’s worth the extra splurge for the results.</p><p><strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Avocado oil, beta-carotene, sodium PCA｜<strong>Usag</strong>e: Apply a rice grain-size amount and tap it in with your ring finger｜<strong>Fragrance-Free</strong>: Yes｜<strong>Size</strong>: 0.51 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-dermatologist-recommended-dermalogica-awaken-peptide-eye-gel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Dermatologist-Recommended</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dermalogica Awaken Peptide Eye Gel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dermalogica Awaken Peptide Eye Gel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9zUTydCFu68KB2bh8ilWJmJeet0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dermalogica-awaken-peptide-eye-gel-e27233a66fbf4d59b7e3db22f380e409.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermalogica</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: The formula sinks in quickly and doesn’t pill under makeup,</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: We were split on how well it hydrated our skin — a few of us found it to be plenty hydrating, while others found it lacking on their drier skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a unique consistency, consider this <strong>lightweight, refreshing, and not-at-all-sticky</strong> eye gel. We noticed a <strong>difference in our dryness after a single application</strong> — and while we were already a fan of the brand, we're happy when products like this live up to the hype. The gel formula <strong>feels like a combination of a serum and a moisturizer</strong>, but it wasn't runny or greasy, nor did we have any issues with pilling or creasing under makeup. (In fact, we felt like <strong>it enhanced our makeup</strong> look.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It left our under-eye area <strong>feeling moisturized and bright</strong>, and <strong>our skin was almost bouncy</strong>. And even though we struggle with chronic puffiness and dark circles, this eye gel has <strong>made a huge difference</strong> in our puffiness on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>The only caveat is that while it's <strong>great for puffiness</strong>, it didn't seem to tighten or firm the under-eye area. Plus, the product came out of the bottle really quickly, so we often ended up with more product than we actually needed, since only a dab is needed.</p><p><strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Peptides, rosemary leaf extract, lactic acid｜<strong>Usage</strong>: Apply it beneath the eyes and around the orbital bone｜<strong>Fragrance-Free</strong>: Yes｜<strong>Size</strong>: 0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-instant-results-kopari-niacinamide--caffeine-eye-bright-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Instant Results</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kopari Niacinamide & Caffeine Eye Bright Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NIACINAMIDE &amp;amp; CAFFEINE EYE BRIGHT CREAM" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9L8SyXXXIogPdrVP0MuhF6qcYP4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/koparibeauty-niacinamide-eye-cream-5dd8744ac08c4ab89a85117af3cf3959.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kopari Beauty</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: It’s hydrating, comfortable, and works on the spot.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: One of us with extra sensitive skin had a reaction to the formula.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those who want <strong>less puffiness ASAP</strong>, we found the fastest and most striking improvements with this <strong>plant, fruit, and vegetable-extract filled </strong>eye cream.

It <strong>layered seamlessly under makeup</strong> and didn't feel heavy or oily; instead, it took just 30 seconds or so for the formula to sink into our skin.

That can help you identify the right active ingredients to seek out. For instance, “those with dry or sensitive skin may do better with a hydrating eye cream, rather than one that contains a retinol,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Dr. Marisa Garshick</a>, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.&nbsp;<p>Meanwhile, if you have oily skin, a gel or more lightweight option may be your best bet. And, of course, if your major concern is dark circles, then you might seek out vitamin C, which helps even out skin tone. While these factors aren’t the sole factor to guide your eye-cream purchase, they can point you in the right direction — and get you closer to the results you want.</p></li><li readability=31><strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: If there’s a single ingredient that can be found across eye creams for puffiness, it’s caffeine —&nbsp;and for good reason. It can help reduce a swollen or puffy eye area, says Dr. Garshick, since it boosts circulation and can help shuttle fluids (which contribute to swelling) away from the under-eye area, quickening their deflation.<p>Another popular pick is retinol, “which is a derivative of vitamin A to help boost collagen production and improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles,” says Dr. Garshick. In other words, it’s a winner for those targeting signs of aging like crow’s feet. And even if you use a retinol elsewhere around the eye, it’s important to find one formulated specifically for the eye area, according to Dr. Robinson.</p><p>For those who want the perks but can’t use or tolerate retinol — which can be drying —&nbsp;Dr. Garshick recommends looking for a product with bakuchiol, a gentler, plant-based alternative. Peptides are another good pick; these help carry out cellular functions, and can help signal for more collagen production or up hydration (depending on the exact peptide).</p><p>When it comes to dark circles, ingredients like niacinamide and vitamin C are solid options. The latter comes with bonus benefits: It can “support overall skin health by protecting against free radical damage and helping to brighten the skin,” says Dr. Garshick.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, your eye cream should moisturize. “For skin texture and tone, focus on hydrating and plumping ingredients — but the good kind of plumping,” says Dr. Robinson. Both she and Dr. Garshick call out hyaluronic acid as a good option to deeply hydrate skin, while she also calls out ceramides; these are naturally found throughout the skin barrier and can help keep moisture trapped in skin, prolonging hydration.</p></li><li><strong>Applicator</strong>: You can often find eye cream in a jar or a tub, but some options come with a dedicated applicator. While it’s not a dealbreaker, “having a cooling, metal-tipped applicator can be helpful to provide an instant depuffing effect and help reduce swelling,” says Dr. Garshick. Many of those on the market have ceramic, which has that cooling sensation and is easy to wipe clean.</li><li><strong>Consistency</strong>: While the texture of an eye cream comes into play with your skin type, it can also be a matter of personal preference and lifestyle. “Some people may prefer an eye serum versus an eye cream, as it may be more lightweight,” says Dr. Garshick. And, if you usually wear concealer, foundation, or both beneath your eyes, a more weightless consistency might make layering easier and create a more natural finish.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I get rid of puffiness under my eye?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve been using an eye cream specifically developed for puffiness for several weeks and you’re still experiencing lingering puffiness, it could be from the build-up of fluid that collects in the eye area as a result of crying, your sleep position, or even your diet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Allergies and inflammation related to dietary sensitivities can also play a role here. “Gentle facial massage with a gua sha or a jade roller may help to move this excess fluid to reduce puffiness,” she says. “Always work your way out from the center of your face and then down the neck with your approach.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Does any eye cream work on under-eye bags?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It depends on what “eye bags” are. If they’re puffy and if you’re working with lax skin that appears to droop, then a formula that helps tightening skin could offer some subtle improvement. But fat can also move into the area as you age, and a topical cream won’t be able to help with that.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you apply an eye cream for puffiness?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the exact method depends on the applicator, if you’re working with an eye cream in a jar or standard tube, “pat a pea sized amount on each eye area using the tip of your ring finger,” says Dr. Robinson. “This prevents you from tugging too hard on the delicate skin.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How should you store an eye cream for puffiness?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As you should with all of your skin “keep out of direct sunlight and in stable room temperature,” says Dr. Robinson. She also recommends storing your eye cream in the fridge, “which keeps it cool, so when you apply it you may get some additional anti-inflammatory benefits,” she says. (However, this won’t make or break your results.)<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Deanna Pai</a> is a freelance writer and editor who has been covering beauty, health, and wellness for more than a decade.
