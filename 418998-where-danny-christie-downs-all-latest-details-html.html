Therefore, it is shocking to hear that a mother would attempt to end her children's lives at a young age. So, what happened to Danny and Christie Downs?</p><h2>Who are Danny and Christie Downs?</h2><p class=align-left>Danny and Christie Ann Downs are among Diane Downs' surviving children after Cheryl Lynn died following the tragic shooting. Christie and Cheryl were a product of Diane's marriage to her ex-husband, Stephen (Danny) Downs. The couple was together between 1973 and 1980 when Steve left her because he believed that Diane was cheating on him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb70d55837c39dc2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Physically Challenged Man Given Weeks to Live, Marries Fianc√© in Beautiful Beach Wedding: "Love of My Life"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Otherwise known as Daniel Downs, Danny was allegedly birthed out of an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">affair</a> between Diane and another man. Later on, she gave birth to a fourth child, Amy Elizabeth, with yet another man in 1984. Her adoptive parents later changed her name to Becky Babcock.</p><h2>What happened to Danny and Christie Downs?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb70d55837c39dc2.jpg><p class=align-left>Until her incarceration, Elizabeth Diane Frederickson Downs worked as a postal worker in Springfield, Oregon. Danny, Christie, and Cheryl were eight, seven, and three, respectively. One night in May 1983, Diane drove into the emergency wing of Mckenzie-Willamette Hospital in Springfield.</p><p class=align-left>She brought in her children, who had suffered severe bullet wounds shot at close range. The medical experts pronounced Cheryl dead on arrival. Christie and her brother younger brother, Danny, were holding on to dear life.</p><p class=align-left>According to her, a bushy-haired stranger had shot Diane Downs' children while attempting to carjack them on a deserted <a href=#>rural road</a>.

Danny suffered injuries that left him paralyzed, while Christie, who had dilated pupils and low blood pressure, sustained a stroke that impaired her speech.</p><p class=align-left>Preliminary investigations into the case showed that Downs was emotionally flat and her story far-fetched. It was also unclear why a mother would take her children sightseeing in the dark. Then, as the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">inquiries</a> continued, the authorities found a notebook where Diane had expressed her love for a man named Lew, who never wanted to see her if the children were around.</p><p class=align-left>A few months after the ordeal, Christie began to recollect the events of that night. She testified before the District Attorney that she had not seen a stranger that night and that her mother was behind the shootings. When asked why her mother would do that, the nine-year-old replied, ''Maybe she loved Lew more than us.''</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0348febfb85ca7fa.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bill Payne and Billie Jean Hayworth murders: What really happened?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The American authorities convicted Diane Downs' for murder, attempted murder, and criminal assault nine months after the fateful incident.
