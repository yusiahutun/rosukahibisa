Robert explained that her death made sense due to all the twists and turns that the Woodbury story had taken in season 3.</p><p class=align-left>In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> in April 2013, Robert Kirkman said:</p>We thought having that tragic end to her story line — having [Andrea] work so hard to save these people of Woodbury and find a peaceful resolution to this conflict was really something worthy of the character. It’s also something that changes Rick’s (Andrew Lincoln) mindset and alters a lot of the characters and their modes of operation moving into the fourth season. It seemed like the right thing to do at the right time.<p class=align-left><i>The Walking Dead</i> creator also discussed Andrea's death and how it served as a motivator for the characters. He thought it was the appropriate decision for the show since it made the Governor a fearsome adversary in season 4 and drove Rick in the direction the writers wanted him to go.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/49285fd8a3975a3d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dateline: Family Business episode: Who killed farmworker Roberto Ayala?</span></p></a><h2>How does Andrea die in the Walking Dead comics?</h2><p class=align-left>In <i>The Walking Dead</i> comics, Andrea Grimes's death came much later than the death of the character in the show.
