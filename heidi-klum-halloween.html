But the German supermodel looks nothing short of stunning in this year's effort for the spooky holiday she loves so much. Heidi gave fans an early glimpse of the Egyptian-themed number she will wear for her annual <a class=hm-link href=#>Halloween</a> bash, which is to be held on October 31 at New York night club Finale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a32c1d0b98b1-heidi-klum-z.jpg><p id=eoZjr805pMn0 data-wc=100>With a huge golden headpiece adding feet to her height, and a tight golden dress and wing style cape, Heidi is transformed into Cleopatra – the last great ruler of ancient Egypt. The gorgeous costume ensures she will surely be the centre of attention at her party, which she has hosted annually for the last 13 years. The impressive outfit was made by designer Martin Izquierdo, who can be seen in a video detailing the making of the costume which the mum-of-four has posted on her website. In it, she tells him she wants it to be: "Big. Bold. Glittery."</p><p id=e_Ldvoywzp5F data-wc=131>The design team also make a mask of Heidi's face so they can cover it in Swarovski crystals for a truly glittering effect. But fans will have to wait for the big night to see the finished effect. Heidi writes in the introduction to the video: "The making of my costume is quite an elaborate process. It takes months of planning and a team of expert designers to put it all together. Costume designer Martin Izquierdo has been creating my costumes for me for years. He's amazing!"This year's party will be a slightly different experience for the blonde beauty. It will be the first time in at least eight years she has attended without her musician husband <a class=hm-link href=#>Seal</a> in tow. The pair <a class=hm-link href=#>split</a> in January after admitting they had "grown apart".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/efa0d318ffd9-heidi-klum-3-a.jpg><p id=emp68HJ0M90X data-wc=209>Seal used to love dressing up for Halloween as much as his wife. Last year he <a class=hm-link href=#>donned a monkey suit</a> so their pair could be a pair of playful primates. In previous years he has joined her in being a crow and a futuristic robot. The musician will be absent, but it remains to be seen if the new man in her life, bodyguard <a class=hm-link href=#>Martin Kristin</a>, will attend. The couple are yet to attend a celebrity social event together though he has been spotted out an about with his girlfriend and her children on numerous occasions. Heidi, 39, recently admitted she was dating Martin, but said it was <a class=hm-link href=#>early days</a>. She told a TV interviewer that the romance had "just started" after she was asked if it was "a proper relationship". She added: "I don't even know if I can call it that. I don't know." The German beauty then gave more detail about her friendship with Martin, saying: "He's been with our family for the last four years. He's cared for our entire family, mostly for our four children, helped us tremendously. I trust him with my children’s life. He’s a great man, you know, and we just got to know each other from a completely different side."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
