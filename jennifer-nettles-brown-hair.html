Unless you ask her son, Magnus (age 2) who, according to her caption, was not as impressed.</p><p>"Darkling. My son's response upon seeing my new color: 'No, not that one.' Hahahaha," Nettles writes.</p><p>“So the cat is out of bag and I can finally say, “Yaaaaaaaaaaaay”! I have been dying to tell. I am so excited!! ‪#‎CoatOfManyColors,” Nettles wrote on Facebook after the announcement.</p><p>The role is not her first acting gig, as Nettles performed on Broadway as Roxie Hart in the musical Chicago.</p><p>Nettles had been working on a new record, but with the label shakeup, no news has come out about the future of the album. The lead-off single “Sugar” was released earlier this summer. Nettles also appeared on <a href=#>Reba McEntire</a>’s latest record,<a title="Reba McEntire Takes Us Behind the Scenes of Jennifer Nettles Duet" href=#> performing a duet called “Enough,”</a> which McEntire says is about two women being in love with the same man. The track is available now on iTunes.</p><p><strong>Jennifer Nettles + More Country Stars With Their Famous Friends</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo52eo7ansdFmpZ6spKGytHnBq6awpl2drqq%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
