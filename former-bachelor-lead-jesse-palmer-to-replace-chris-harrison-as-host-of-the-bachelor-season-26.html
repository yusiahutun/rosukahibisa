In many ways it was a different show and a different world, but the ESPN analyst is confident his experiences will prove beneficial for contestants.</p><p>"Bachelorette" <a href=#>Katie Thurston</a> certainly leaned on Tayshia and Kaitlyn's knowledge of the process and experience in her season, creating a camaraderie and intimacy among them that was fresh and exciting to watch.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c5328d8c-110f-4b2d-b66c-7f121c204d4f data-container-ref=toofab:article:f72e5475-c7b1-4a88-bfb9-ee401651b0e2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/87/5by4/2021/09/28/87eb59f269fc4922bc6ba3740df006f4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">DWTS 5th Judge: Who Went Home First? -- Plus, Cheryl's Positive Covid Test & What Is Tyra Banks Wearing?!</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"For more than 20 years, 'The Bachelor' has brought the world dozens of unforgettable love stories, including at one time, my own," Palmer said in a statement, per <a href=#>TMZ</a>.</p><p>"Falling in love is one of lifeâ€™s greatest gifts, and I am humbled by the opportunity to return to the show as host this season to offer the newest Bachelor advice gained from firsthand experience and I am grateful to play a small part in his journey."</p><p>Jesse selected Jessica Bowlin as his winner in 2004, but their relationship fizzled out after a few months. Even though he didn't find love on "The Bachelor," Jesse did find love in his life, getting engaged to Emely Fardo Palmer in 2019, with recent Instagram posts suggesting they may now be married.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2b4f6cd4-23b7-4239-a320-5378fec3b8ce data-container-ref=toofab:article:f72e5475-c7b1-4a88-bfb9-ee401651b0e2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a1/5by4/2021/09/28/a1412c8e93fb49898ec5df5bb236dfe4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Fox Launching 'Real Dirty Dancing' Special with Brie Bella, One of the Backstreet Boys and More!</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In other words, he has some experience in not only the ups and downs of the show, but in relationships in general. He took longer to find his happily ever after than he probably would have liked, but that also gives him a more unique perspective on that journey that he can share.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Jesse celebrated the announcement with a shot of himself on the set shared to his Instagram page.
