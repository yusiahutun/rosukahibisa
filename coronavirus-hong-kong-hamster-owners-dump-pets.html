“Owners should not just leave them on the street where there are cats, dogs, eagles or other predators. They should allow them a chance to live,” said volunteer Pamper Le.
Le said that she and six other volunteers were caring for more than 40 hamsters handed over by owners or picked up off the streets."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Their study was published in the medical journal The Lancet on Saturday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/02/901ce6bf-b42e-4393-9b16-28f62299cd62_db5bb398.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As of January 22, 2,298 hamsters and nearly 300 small animals including rabbits, chinchillas and guinea pigs kept with the hamsters had been culled.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All 35 licensed pet stores selling hamsters were also ordered to temporarily suspend operations, with most reopening on Sunday after undergoing thorough disinfection measures and environmental swab tests.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Emphasising the importance of surrendering hamsters bought on or after December 22, an AFCD spokeswoman told the Post: “The onset of symptoms may not be triggered immediately after the hamsters are infected and current negative test results do not necessarily mean the hamsters concerned have not been infected.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In other words, touching or keeping these hamsters can cause infection and also risk spreading the virus,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hamster concern group HamuClan said that since the culling order, it had taken in more than 50 hamsters, mostly handed over by owners, although some had been brought in from the streets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Noel Louie, who runs the group, said the hamsters were all healthy and most were bought before December 22.

street.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it had stopped accepting hamsters since January 18, as its isolation facility had run out of space, but the group still continued to receive numerous calls from pet owners.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We learned that some hamster owners did not fully understand the situation,” said the organisation’s spokeswoman.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The group emphasised that there was no rule affecting animals bought before December 22 and appealed to owners not to dump their pets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">HamuClan’s Louie said that while people were willing to take in abandoned hamsters, few realised that keeping the animals was more costly than just buying them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She said that although a Campbell’s dwarf hamster cost HK$12 to HK$68 and other breeds were worth between HK$120 and HK$480, potential owners needed to know the price of a cage and other supplies was about HK$1,000 (US$128) in total.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hamsters generally live for up to three years, Louie said, with medical fees for any potential surgery ranging from a few thousand dollars to HK$10,000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When we talked to them, we realised they did not know about the high cost of keeping a hamster,” she said, adding that the group was currently not proceeding with adoptions.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=#

hard.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alan Cheng Ying-lun, 46, who has run a hamster shop in Mong Kok for 12 years, said panic-stricken customers had rushed to return pets, even those bought before December 22.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They asked us to prove the pets were healthy and without any virus infection, but we lack the medical expertise,” he said. “We used to earn at least double during festivals like Christmas and New Year’s Day, but now we cannot see the end of the contemporary closure.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yau Pai-dan, 32, who runs an online pet supply store, said he used to earn about HK$4,000 a month selling hamster snacks, supplements and accessories, but business had dropped by 80 per cent following the cull.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cat shop owner Mary Tsang, 63, said her previous earnings of about HK$120,000 a month have also been hit hard.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People are afraid the animals are virus carriers, so they’ve become more cautious about owning a pet during the pandemic,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Friday, the government announced a one-off payment to all pet shops selling hamsters as financial relief.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Payments of between HK$10,000 and HK$30,000 would be worked out based on the size of the shops, and owners could apply from February 5 to 25.</p><p
