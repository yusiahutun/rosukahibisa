I personally think that’s an easier question to answer with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>makeup brands</a> and becomes infinitely more difficult when it comes to skincare. There is just so much out there, and while some brands have a great hero product or two, there are few where the entire line excites me. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Typology, however, is the exception</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born in Paris, Typology is the epitome of chic French minimalism in both its aesthetic and mentality. Most of the products come in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">semi-opaque brown bottles</a> reminiscent of vintage pharmaceutical products with the active ingredients and their percentage listed in typewriter font. The products are also pretty affordable relative to the skincare landscape; most products are somewhere between $18-$35. Think of this as an elevated, French version of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>The Ordinary</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s a great solution for ingredient-focused and knowledgeable shoppers (such as myself). I like to be able to look at the front of a bottle and quickly decipher whether or not it’s for me. For example, I know my skin likes caffeine and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>salicylic acid</a>, but isn’t fond of blue tansy and most retinols.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you don’t know what ingredients your skin likes, these are still great options. The back of the bottles tells you what skincare concerns it targets, like “eyelashes and brows” or “dark circles and puffy eyes.” If the product ends up working for you, you very easily learn that it’s one of two, or maximum three, active ingredients that you should look for in future products.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At this moment, there are over 120 products that cover every possible step of your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">skin care</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">hair care</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">body care</a> routine. There are also a few hybrid makeup products that are absolutely divine — tinted serums, eye cream concealers, etc.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because there are so many products, it can be difficult to know where to start. Below are six products to begin your Typology journey.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-typology-caffeine-eye-serum></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Typology Caffeine Eye Serum</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Typology</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$18; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">us.typology.com</a><br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The dark circles around my eyes are incredibly rude and aggressive. It seems like one day I just woke up with them and they’ve been there since. This serum is so thin, almost like water, and just seeps into my skin instantly. It also had a remarkable instant effect, thirty seconds after applying I remarked out loud, “oh wow, that worked quick. That can’t be right?!”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I thought maybe I had some panda mascara residue and that it had simply wiped it away, but no — every time I apply this serum, my eyes are instantly brighter. The long-term benefits of caffeine and niacinamide are great, too; I’ve noticed that my wrinkles aren’t as deep and my dark circles are less drastic.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-typology-tinted-serum></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Typology Tinted Serum</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Typology</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $38; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">us.typology.com</a><br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Okay, this could give another very popular serum that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I won’t mention by name</a> a real run for its money. I find other tinted serums to be patchy, and oily, and make me wish I had just reached for a foundation instead.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This one is nothing like that. It looks like my skin drinks it up and becomes its best self. It conceals unevenness in my complexion, redness, and pores. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vitamin C</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">squalane</a> also brighten and hydrate my complexion in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As one of the 1,000 plus five-star reviewers wrote, “in addition to the immediate cosmetic effect of even, dewy skin, I am also seeing results to the overall appearance of my bare skin. I have discarded all other serum foundations and concealers.” (Speaking of concealers, Typology also makes a great <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">eye cream-concealer hybrid</a>.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-typology-tinted-lip-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Typology Tinted Lip Oil&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Typology</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $24; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">us.typology.com</a><br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A lot of lip “oils” feel more like balms or glosses and that’s totally okay — but this one is exactly what it says it is. It’s light and non-sticky like an oil, but not at all runny or greasy. Thanks to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>jojoba oil</a>, squalane, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>vitamin E</a> this is incredibly nourishing and softening. I’ve also found that it lasts on my lips for hours and in the long run has made me need less lip balm.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It comes in a clear option as well as four other shades, all of which are universally flattering. I was personally hesitant by the color of the red and coral in the bottle, but when applied, it’s a very soft coat that just slightly adjusts your natural lips.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-typology-10-ingredient-hand-balm></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Typology 10-Ingredient Hand Balm</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Typology</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $19; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">us.typology.com</a><br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As I write this from the office I am just absolutely conjuring at how dry and sandpaper-like my hands feel because I have forgotten this hand cream at home and this cold air is sucking every drop of moisture out of me.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hyaluronic acid</a> and coconut oil-formulated hand cream is an absolute dream, and I’m far from the only person who thinks so, it has nearly 200 perfect reviews. “It starts like a balm but doesn’t leave a greasy feeling at all,” one reviewer wrote, “it gets absorbed really fast.”&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-typology-nine-ingredient-face-moisturizer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Typology Nine-Ingredient Face Moisturizer</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Typology</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $27; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">us.typology.com</a><br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If the nearly 1,400 five-star reviews are of any indication, this is potentially Typology’s pièce de résistance.
