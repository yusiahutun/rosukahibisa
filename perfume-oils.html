Oils tend to “stick” to the skin and linger, whereas many standard perfumes are actually better applied to clothing for longer wear as fabrics give them something to cling to.</p><p><strong>They’re less likely to be irritating on skin.</strong><br>It goes without saying that the alcohol and other dehydrating chemicals in most perfumes can be irritating and drying to the skin. Those with dry skin often have a hard time wearing scent because of how quickly it dries and dissipates. Oils, on the other hand, are moisturizing, which not only helps them to last longer but also makes them suitable for any skin type.</p><p><strong>They’re more bang for your buck.</strong><br>Oil fragrances are typically packaged as rollerballs, which you then apply to warm areas like your wrists, inside of your elbow, behind your ears, and the back of your neck (<a href=#><strong>Liv Tyler</strong>&nbsp;suggests applying it inside your belly button!</a>). You can apply as much or as a little of the scent as you want, allowing for total control. Standard alcohol-based perfumes in spray bottles often feel like they’re being wasted, especially when you’re spraying it into the air and walking through the resulting mist. A cheap alcohol-based perfume almost always smells like just that, but you can pick up a great-smelling one-note oil fragrance like sandalwood or musk at health food stores for under $10.</p><p><strong>They’re less overpowering.</strong><br>It’s true that the higher concentration in oil <a href=#>fragrances</a> often makes them smell stronger and richer, but they’re less likely than alcohol-based perfumes to leave behind a sillage or trail. If you’re sensitive to overbearing fragrance that feel like you’re walking around in a cloud of scent, oils are the perfect solution. They stay close to the skin and radiate outward thanks to the warmth of your pulse points, but you’ll feel like you’re wearing a scent rather than having a scent wear <i>you</i>.</p><p>Read more: <a href=#><strong>The 5 Rules of Wearing Fragrance</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWSCd4SWbW9oqJWns7a5xGamoqSjZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
