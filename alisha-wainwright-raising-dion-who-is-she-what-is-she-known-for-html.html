But who is this star? Where did she come from and what else is she known for?</p><h2>Who is Alisha Wainwright of ‘Raising Dion’?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Alisha-Wainwright-Raising-Dion-who-she-is-and-what-shes-known-for.jpg><p id=par-3_46>Alisha Wainwright<a href=#> was born on July 14, 1989</a>, in Florida.

It makes sense that she wants to keep her family as private as she can.</p><p id=par-4_49>She appeared on <a href=#>the YouTube channel Smosh</a> in 2012, which might be seen by some as a start to her career. She is active on both Instagram and Twitter, having large followings on both social media platforms. On top of all of this, she is a talented actress.</p><h2>What else is she known for?</h2><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_54><a href=#>According to her IMDB page</a>, she is known for a variety of roles.
