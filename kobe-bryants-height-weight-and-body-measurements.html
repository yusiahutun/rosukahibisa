As commendable as that is, it makes us all the more curious about the man behind the name. Before we look at Kobe Bryant’s height, weight, and body measurements, we want to know a few facts about the athlete himself.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> He was born Kobe Bean Bryant on 23 August 1978 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Here is interesting information, he is named after a Japanese steakhouse in Philadelphia. His parents had dinner there sometime before he was born, and the service must have been really amazing for them to name their child after him.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> His parents must be very liberal when it comes to naming their children, his middle name is different from what is written on his birth certificate. He was called “Bean” after his father’s nickname Jelly Bean, but it was not officially recorded on the documents. But “Bean”?</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Bryant is bilingual; yes, the retired sportsman grew up in Italy and learned the language quickly and mainly because he wanted to fit in with the other children at his school in Italy. However, this was to his advantage, as he used the language frequently to interact with his teammates during the games.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kobe-Bryant.jpg fetchpriority=high decoding=async alt="Kobe Bryant’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements" width=768 height=384 title="Kobe Bryant’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements" data-sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>4.</strong> Make no mistake, he didn’t rely on basketball because he couldn’t cope with his schoolwork, he was a brilliant student; he got good grades in class and a high score on his SATs.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Guess who Bryant went to his high school prom with? His date was none other than Brandy, she wasn’t in school and as such never went to the prom, so he helped a sister out and landed a famous date.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Sloane Stephens Boyfriend, Father, Mother (Sybil Smith), Net Worth</a></strong></p><p><strong>6.</strong> He got into the NBA right after high school.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> Throughout his entire career, the athlete had only one scandal, he was and still is known for keeping his private life to himself.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Kobe Bryant ended his 20-year career in the NBA on April 13, 2016.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Lakers-lose-Suns-Kobe-Bryant.jpg decoding=async alt="Kobe Bryant’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements" width=768 height=433 title="Kobe Bryant’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements" data-sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Kobe Bryant Height</strong></h2><p>He is a retired basketball player, so you best believe that he is not lacking in the height department, as this is one of the main requirements for the job. The athlete is 6’1″, but at some point (when he first entered the NBA) his stated height was actually 6’1″.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Rising-Sons-with-Kobe-Bryant.jpg decoding=async alt="Kobe Bryant’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements" width=768 height=512 title="Kobe Bryant’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements" data-sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Wow! That’s many centimeters shaved off. So how did we get this little information about Kobe Bryant’s height? It was provided by the athlete himself, we believe his exact words were: “Everyone thinks I’m 1.70 m tall. But just between you and me, I’m actually 6-4, I’m probably 6-5 sneaking around”.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kobe-Bryant1.jpg decoding=async alt="Kobe Bryant’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements" width=768 height=515 title="Kobe Bryant’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements" data-sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>There you have it, it’s not every day that a celebrity admits that their stated height is wrong, so that’s pretty commendable. With this kind of news you have to wonder what other kinds of exaggerations they tell us about professional athletes.</p><p>Anyway, it’s time for a comparison; here is a list of other celebrities who share Kobe Bryant’s height: Drake, Stephen King, Liam Neeson, and Michael Phelps all stand as tall as the athlete himself.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Stephen Curry’s Brother, Sister, And Parents</a></strong></p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kobe-Bryant-Height.jpg decoding=async alt="Kobe Bryant’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements" width=768 height=543 title="Kobe Bryant’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements" data-sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Kobe Bryant weight</strong></h2><p>Bryant has a healthy weight of 96 kg, as you can best believe. He has also started a trend in the basketball world, and we are sure he had no idea that many other players would follow him. In the summer of 2007, when he was 29 years old and entering his 12th NBA season, Kobe also had the two best statistical seasons of his life behind him.</p><p>Instead of letting time pass, he lost 9 kg, and boy, did he get results. In the following three years, he won two titles, reached the NBA finals every year, averaged 27 points per game, and missed only nine of 246 regular-season games. That was reason enough for other players like LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwayne Wade to lose a few pounds.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kobe-Bryant-Weight.jpg decoding=async alt="Kobe Bryant’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements" width=768 height=461 title="Kobe Bryant’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements" data-sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Kobe Bryant Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>In addition to Kobe Bryant’s height and weight, here is a summary of all his body measurements.</p><p><strong>Height:</strong> 6 feet 4 inches</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;96 kg or&nbsp;212 lbs</p><p><strong>Chest size:</strong>&nbsp;43 in or 109 cm</p><p><strong>Arms/biceps</strong> size:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>16.5 in or 42 cm</p><p><strong>Waist size:&nbsp;</strong>35 in or 89 cm</p><p><strong>Feet/ Shoe Size:&nbsp;</strong>14 US,47 EU, 13.5 UK.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuLCuxGaZq7GRo8G0eceeoKCgpGLEprXGoatmmZ6ZeqO7w7Jkpp2RqMKzscyepa2rXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
