The artists "will decide what to sing in the spur of the moment, with no setlist, as they casually swap songs and stories during All for the Hall New York."</p><p>Simon is one of the most important artists in the history of popular music. He has won a total of 12 Grammy awards, including three Album of the Year trophies for <a href=#>Simon and Garfunkel</a>'s Bridge Over Troubled Water, as well as his solo albums, Still Crazy After All These Years and Graceland. Among his many honors, he's received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award for his work with Simon and Garfunkel, is a double Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, and has been awarded the Kennedy Center Honors and the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song.</p><p>All for the Hall New York is slated to take place at Best Buy Theater in Times Square on Tuesday, Oct. 6. Tickets are currently on sale for $100 for mezzanine seats only. There are also a limited number of VIP tables and tickets available, and patrons have the option of purchasing a full table of 10 for $10,000, a half table for $5,000, or individual floor-level seats for $1,000 each.</p><p><strong>What's the Best Album of 2015?</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmqZmloXq0tcyopWaZnKF6p7vRZquhnV2drq24jKecsGWppL%2Bsew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
