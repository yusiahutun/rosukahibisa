Jaylin Sellers added 15 points as the Knights (14-12, 5-9 Big 12) won over a ranked opponent for just the third time this season. The Red Raiders (19-8, 8-6) fell to 2-6 in true road games despite a double-double of 19 points and 11 rebounds from Darrion Williams and 18 points from Kerwin Walton. Down 63-52 with 5:20 to go and looking to overcome its fifth double-digit deficit of the year for a win, the comeback hopes stalled during a drought of seven-plus minutes without a field goal. Texas Tech missed eight of its final 10 field goals in the loss. The Knights went into halftime leading 36-32 and got two big jumpers from Shemarri Allen to help stretch their lead to 40-34 with 16:43 to go. Walton had the Red Raiders within 53-50 after hitting a jumper midway through the half but Johnson buried two clutch 3-pointers late in the half, including one with 5:20 remaining that put the Knights up 11. A back and forth affair early, though with Texas Tech always staying a step ahead, the Knights took their first lead of the day on a layup by DeMarr Langford with 9:39 left. The shot was part of an 8-0 run that forced the Red Raiders to call a timeout after Antwann Jones scored inside a little over a minute later. Walton didn't let the momentum shift last long, burying back-to-back 3-pointers as Texas Tech pushed back in front 27-26 with 3:14 remaining. His play in the first half was instrumental as he hit three 3-pointers and scored 12. But back came the Knights, who ended a nearly four-minute field goal drought with a 3-pointer from Sellers with 2:55 to go, sparking an 8-0 run where Johnson also connected from long range as UCF took a 34-27. --Field Level Media</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKugpL%2B1v46nmK2hn6OurXvDmqmiraNit7C0zaymp2WYmrmxv4yump9llKTEr3nNqGRra12psrmt0marnpuYZK6zwMico56XlpiwdoLCbZxmb2Vmhm6BkG9pZnFgmX9ug8JxbmmZk26Cp3yUZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
