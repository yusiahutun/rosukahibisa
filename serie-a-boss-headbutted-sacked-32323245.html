The 48-year-old lost his cool after Lecce's 1-0 defeat at home to Hellas Verona on Sunday (March 10) which left them 15th in the table and just one point above 18th-placed Frosinone.
Following the full-time whistle, D'Aversa confronted Verona striker Thomas Henry who was shown a straight red card in the 97th minute as well as the Lecce boss who was shown his marching orders by referee Daniele Chiffi."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The headbutt seemed to be the breaking point in between the club and D'Aversa with Lecce having won just two league games since October. The German-born manager was appointed at the start of this season having signing a one-year deal with a further 12-month option if they avoided relegation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article31393559.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_PS081123dailystarchat.jpg><p>Fans were left in shock with the Italian's actions with one X (formerly Twitter) user writing: "Bro thinks this is <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>WWE</a>" while another had a similar quip with: "A WWE manager in football".</p><p>A third user lamented Lecce's decision to sack D'Aversa as they commented: "Why would you sack a manager because of that? What about players who headbutt other players all the time? This is not a valid reason to sack a manager IMO." Meanwhile, a fourth explained exactly why his sacking was justified by replying: "Mate it's assault. What do you mean its not a valid reason".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cL%2FEq6CeZZFir7C%2F0mafnpmUl8K1wMSdZKyZk6CypXmSa2pra2Jpgg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
