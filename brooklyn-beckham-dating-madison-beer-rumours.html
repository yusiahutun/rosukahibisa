Yes."</p><p id=emOAbdcb4p_ data-wc=53>Last month, Brooklyn attended a dinner hosted by Madison in London, where the couple put on a cosy display. The pair were also seen at a concert in California together, and enjoyed a night out at West Hollywood hotspot Catch L.A. The young lovebirds arrived hand-in-hand and were joined by Brooklyn's mum Victoria.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8a4deac90fbb-brooklyn-beckham-and-rumoured-girlfriend-madison-beer-at-dinner-in-london-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eeQb1Lrq9g9 data-wc=7><strong>The pair pictured in London in June</strong></p><p id=eloGTDj0Xoo><a class=hm-link href=#>Gallery: David Beckham's best fatherhood moments</a></p><p id=e4RYa3-YF7mu data-wc=73>When asked about their various outings, Madison admitted that they are "crushing" on each other, but they're not together. "Ok here we go," she said. "No, I've known Brooklyn for years, we've been really close, and as we've gotten older and I'm newly out of a long relationship, we definitely are crushing on each other but we're both very busy and I just think, it's like, I don't know, I don't know man.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=ex1ylrUuvQrw data-wc=91>"He's great though, he's a cutie, he's literally one of my best friends which is hard because now every time I'm seen with him, people are like, 'Oh my god they're boyfriend and girlfriend,' but really, we're seriously best friends. We hang out almost every day with our whole group of friends in LA together and <a class=hm-link href=#>he's moving to New York</a> soon, so it's just kind of like, we're just having fun right now, and rumours are going to get started."
