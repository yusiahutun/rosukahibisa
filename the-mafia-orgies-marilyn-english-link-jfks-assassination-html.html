In two typed letters postmarked Wimbledon and addressed to the FBI's Dallas office, the informant recounts how he became embroiled in the plot to murder President John F. Kennedy seven years earlier - and warns that his youngest brother, Edward, is next on the Mob's hit-list.<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/23/article-1289077-0A2BF336000005DC-340_468x529.jpg height=529 width=468 alt="Orgies: Marilyn Monroe was said to have been a regular at sex parties attended by the Kennedy brothers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Orgies: Marilyn Monroe was said to have been a regular at sex parties attended by the Kennedy brothers</p><p>'In 1961 I attended a general meeting of the Mafia, during which the main discussion was the killing of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King,' writes the tipster, whose name has been blanked out of the file for obvious reasons. 'Although you may have closed your file on the killing of the President, you are wrong. The man who actually killed him, also the man who paid the killer, is alive and at this moment preparing to kill Senator E. Kennedy (JFK's younger brother Teddy) and Mr Nixon (then newly installed in the White House).'<br></p><p>Claiming to have harboured JFK's hit-man in England for three years after the president was shot, the tipster says his conscience is troubling him and offers to help the FBI trap the assassin. But he pleads with them to preserve his confidentiality 'for if any of this leaks out I am a dead man'.<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/23/article-1289077-0A2BF82F000005DC-735_468x351.jpg height=351 width=468 alt="Damned of brothers: Robert, Ted and John Kennedy, two of whom were shot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Damned of brothers: Robert, Ted and John Kennedy, two of whom were shot</p><p>Frustratingly, the outcome of the Wimbledon letters inquiry is not recorded. And, of course, Edward Kennedy did not fall to a hit-man's bullet all those years ago, like JFK and his other brother, Robert, who was shot in a Los Angeles hotel in 1968. The youngest of the trio died only last summer; then a florid-faced, white-haired old man of 77, he finally succumbed to a brain tumour.<br></p><p>However, the very fact that these reports were read personally by the FBI's legendary director, J. Edgar Hoover, who ordered his London-based agents to meet the informer and fully investigate his story, tells us they were taken very seriously.<br></p><p>Reading this historic archive - which has just been made public under U.S. freedom of information laws, despite an attempt to keep it secret by Ted Kennedy's widow, Victoria - one understands why.<br></p><p>Despite the banal and grammatically flawed language of the 'G-men', as the bureau's gumshoes are known, one can almost reach out and touch the vicious hatred directed towards carousing Senator Teddy and his clan of playboy politicos.<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/23/article-1289077-0048961300000258-334_468x452.jpg height=452 width=468 alt="(L-R) are Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop. It was claimed that Sammy Davis Jr, Sinatra and Peter Lawford attended sex parties" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>(L-R) are Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop. It was claimed that Sammy Davis Jr, Sinatra and Peter Lawford attended sex parties</p><p>Over the years the FBI received many tips that the Mafia were out to get Teddy and conspiracy theorists will make much of this. They will no doubt claim it reinforces a long-held theory - that JFK was not murdered by a lone gunman (Lee Harvey Oswald), but was the victim of a Mob hit, and perhaps even Robert Kennedy, too.<br></p><p>The Mafia certainly held many grudges against the family, dating back to the days when patriarch, Joseph Kennedy, made his fortune with their help in Boston. But they became disgruntled after allegedly rigging a key election in JFK's favour in Chicago in 1960. They expected the favour to be returned, but once in office he determined to put an end to organised crime, and as his attorney general, Robert, spearheaded his war on the Mafia.<br></p><p>But the death threats against Edward began even before he entered the U.S. Senate, as a young man of 30, and came from almost every quarter of American society. His innumerable enemies included embittered Vietnam War veterans angered by his 'Commie' views; Irish Protestants infuriated by his support for the IRA; white supremacists such as the Ku Klux Klan; plus the plethora of deranged loners who simply wanted to get him because he was a Kennedy.<br></p><p>Then there were the many moralists, outraged by the married Kennedy's serial womanising and in particular his reprehensible behaviour after the affair which forever sealed his reputation as a self-serving coward . . . the death of pretty 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne, whom he left to drown when his car plunged off a bridge following a drunken party at Chappaquiddick.<br></p><p>Yet, much as the FBI files tell us about Edward Kennedy, they are perhaps more illuminating about the enigmatic Hoover, who founded the organisation in 1935 and remained in charge until his death 37 years later.<br></p><p>Plainly obsessed with the Kennedys, he was desperate to know every detail of their lives. A closet homosexual, Hoover was particularly interested in their innumerable sexual adventures, which at once fascinated and repulsed him.<br></p><p>One can well imagine the goggle-eyed director, arguably the most influential figure in America's corridors of power, solemnly perusing the latest through-the-bedroom-keyhole account, hot off the telex from one of his agents.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<span> </span><span>'They're going to shoot my ass off the way they shot off Bobby's,' Ted Kennedy once remarked. </span><span></span></p><p>Best-selling Kennedy author Christopher Andersen attributes the FBI chief's prurient interest in Teddy partly to the fact that his organisation failed to protect JFK and Robert. But, as he remarks: 'If we didn't already know the Kennedys were a bizarre combination of Camelot and the Borgias, we surely do now.<br></p><p>'FBI agents doggedly recorded every rumour, every overheard conversation, every titbit of gossip and innuendo. No matter how unreliable or even silly a tip was, it wound up in the files.'<br></p><p>Indeed so. All-embracing as they are, the newly released files only cover the years from 1961 to 1985. But from the first log it is clear that Ted Kennedy was singled out for the sort of attention we might expect in a police state, not the world's greatest democracy.<br></p><p>One early report, made in 1961, records Ted Kennedy's fact-finding visit to Central and South America. On his way home, he left his diary on the plane and it was found by a cleaner. Very conveniently, though, it was not returned to its owner, but to the prying FBI.<br></p><p>Every scrawled page is duly photocopied and filed, and at the height of the Cold War it isn't only Kennedy's earnest admiration for Venezuelan socialism that raises eyebrows at the bureau's Washington HQ. '11.30. Return to hotel - see ****,' Kennedy has scribbled in the diary, the name of his late-night companion having been erased presumably to spare her blushes.<br></p><p>'We have night-cap and hit the sack at 12.00.'<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/23/article-1289077-00C73D1B00000190-732_468x352.jpg height=352 width=468 alt="Enemies: John and Robert Kennedy with FBI director J Edgar Hoover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Enemies: John and Robert Kennedy with FBI director J Edgar Hoover</p><p>At the time Teddy had been married for just three years to his first wife, Joan, and this is his first secretly recorded act of adultery. But it was by no means the last. In fact, his cheating is a recurrent theme in the secret dossier, and as Christopher Andersen says: 'These files remind us that, for most of his life, Teddy like the rest of his family was engaged in an almost frantic pursuit of power, money and sex - and if other people got hurt, that was just too bad.'<br></p><p>In a report filed in July 1965, by which time Teddy was an apparently clean cut senator aged 33, the scene switches to the Carlyle, the swankiest hotel in New York. Already he is being tipped to follow the slain JFK into the White House, but his debauchery of just a few years before, had it been more widely known, would have put paid to his presidential ambitions.<br></p><p>'It was reported that Mrs Jacqueline Hammond, age 40, has considerable information concerning sex parties . . . in which a number of persons participated at different times,' the file reads. 'Among those mentioned were the following individuals: Robert F. Kennedy, John F. Kennedy, Teddy Kennedy, Sammy Davis Jr, Mr and Mrs Peter Lawford, Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe.'<br></p><p>The hostess of these orgies, Mrs Hammond, was a millionaire mother–of-two who was divorced from the former U.S. ambassador to Spain, who retained a room at the Carlyle.<br></p><p>Then a Hollywood heart-throb, Lawford was still married to the Kennedys' sister, Patricia, which doesn't seem to have bothered them. The other named participants need no introduction. Monroe had died in 1962, three years before the unidentified snitch behind this report contacted the FBI.<br></p><p>JFK was long dead, too, of course, and there appears to be no corroboration for this potentially explosive tip-off. None of this seemed to concern Hoover, however, and the information went into Kennedy's bulging manila files.<br></p><p>Just a few days later, Sinatra's name was whispered to the FBI in connection with the Kennedys again - only this time he was said to be at the heart of a plot devised by the Mafia to discredit Teddy, Robert and Lawford.<br></p><p>The tip-off came from a 'reliable' informant 'acquainted with some of the Italian hoodlum element in Milwaukee', who claimed Sinatra's Mob associates planned to smear the trio by setting them up 'in a compromising situation' with women.<br></p><p>Where Teddy was concerned it would have been like leading bees to honey, for he appears to have sown his wild oats across the 50 states. On one trip to Nevada, ostensibly to discuss underground nuclear missile testing, he reportedly sloped off to a Las Vegas casino hotel, picked up a 'bosomy' blonde showgirl, aged 25, and repaired to his room, ordering up a bottle of Scotch and a bottle of vodka.<br></p><p>The married senator didn't appear to care that his close-protection detectives were staying on the same floor - much less that his character was under the microscope after the infamous Chappaquiddick episode, which had occurred just a month earlier.<br></p><p>The incident with which his name will for ever be associated happened in July 1969 after a party for the so-called 'Boiler Room Girls' - a group of youthful, and predictably attractive young female volunteers who had helped with Bobby Kennedy's ill-fated presidential campaign.<br></p><p>After downing Bacardi and Cokes, Teddy drove away late at night with Mary Jo in the passenger seat. For reasons that have never been adequately explained, the car veered off a bridge, overturned and sank in the creek. Mary Jo drowned, but although<br>Kennedy escaped he did not even raise the alarm until the following morning, by which time her body had already been found.<br></p><p>Kennedy always denied any impropriety, claiming he barely knew Mary Jo and was simply giving her a lift, and insisted that he had dived repeatedly into the river in an effort to rescue her.<br></p><p>But although he escaped with a suspended two-month jail sentence, his conduct that night appalled the nation and wrecked his hopes of becoming president.<br></p><p>Indeed, the files reveal little else about the incident, but from them we can see how the fall-out tainted Kennedy’s life long afterwards. Convinced that Kennedy would be<br>his Democratic opponent at the next presidential election, and intent on using Chappaquiddick to blacken his name, President Richard Nixon took a special interest in the saga.<br></p><p>His aides appear to have discovered that Kennedy had holidayed in Greece without his wife the previous year, so a young White House lawyer, John W. Dean III, was ordered to find out if Mary Jo had been with him.<br></p><p>Dean, who later became Nixon’s chief counsel and was embroiled in Watergate, duly asked the FBI to check her passport records. Hoover granted this request without question.<br></p><p>Frustratingly, however, we are not told whether they had a secret tryst, for the results of the inquiry have been expunged from the files. As information can only be withheld on the grounds that it might be damaging to a living person, and not because it might cause embarrassment or scandal, we can only guess as to why it has been withheld.<br></p><p>The assumption must be that the FBI decided it might upset Kopechne's surviving relatives - or Kennedy's. When I spoke to Mr Dean at his California home this week, he insisted he did not know the answer either.<br></p><p>'I didn't even know why I was asking the question,' he told me. 'It did seem odd at the time. But when you are 30 years old, your boss is the Attorney General and you are asked to call the FBI, you call the FBI. It's ancient history now.'<br></p><p>Perhaps so, but endlessly fascinating nonetheless. If Kennedy's life had been in danger before he left poor Mary Jo, afterwards the threats came thick and fast. 'Senator Kennedy, you are a dirty rotton [sic] murderer,' began one typical letter, penned on yellow paper. 'Your two brothers were killed unjustly, but when you get murdered it will be a blessing.'<br></p><p>The writer claimed Kopechne had been pregnant when she drowned - and others came forward with similarly dark theories. Some of threats sound grimly amusing. One came from a prostitute who vowed to kill Kennedy for 'being an immoral man'.<br></p><p>Another was sent by a psychic who predicted his impending doom and boasted of a '96.1 accuracy rate'.<br></p><p>But most professional assassins don't send warnings through the post, and news of the most worrying plots reached the FBI vi a informants. Among them was a chilling tip from a prisoner in California, who for 18 months occupied a cell next to Robert Kennedy's killer, Sirhan Sirhan.<br></p><p>He claimed the deranged Palestinian assassin, who is believed to have shot Robert in 1968 over his pro-Israeli politics, offered him one million dollars - plus a car - in return for murdering Teddy. Small wonder that Teddy would jump whenever he heard a sudden loud noise.<br></p><p>They're going to shoot my ass off the way they shot off Bobby's,' he once remarked.<br></p><p>In the opinion of historian Douglas Brinkley, the newly released files - sensational as they are - contain nothing that will further damage Ted Kennedy's reputation. To the contrary, he says, they 'show how brave he was to run for president, to go out on the road, and try to have a normal life with a bull's eye on his chest'.<br></p><p>However, given his conduct after Chappaquiddick, and the despicable way he conducted himself after his brothers were murdered, it is difficult to regard him as any kind of hero.<br></p><p>And remember, thus far we have been privy only to the first part of his life. Very soon the FBI will be compelled to release a second file, covering his later years. Doubtless it will include his role in the attempted cover-up of an alleged rape by his nephew, William Kennedy Smith on a Florida beach in 1991 (Smith was acquitted).<br></p><p>Though the FBI's all-seeing founder was by then long dead, his methods endure, and we can be sure that many other lurid interludes have been recorded. For everyone who remains intrigued with America's first family, they will be enlightening and entertaining.<br></p><p>But for the benighted Kennedy clan, and especially playboy Teddy's widow, they will make for painful reading.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bc4SYaW5wZ4Sdsm6ZwJ%2BgmmWfp7SqsdJmhJqqmaHGr3mkp56loaOdeq21zaRkg357qHqiv9KaqqyhnpbBqrvNZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
