But then I’d read my fan mail from little kids who would write, ‘You are the most beautiful-est vampire I have ever seen,’ and I’d feel good. Almost.”</p><p class=p1><i>The Munsters</i>, which Yvonne starred on from 1964 to 1966, represented a difficult time for the actress. Throughout the 1940s and ’50s, she had performed in dozens of films — including 1956’s <i>The Ten Commandments </i>— and yet found herself struggling to find work by the 1960s.</p><p class=p1>“She was a talented lady and quite beautiful,” muses <strong>Geoffrey Mark</strong>, a pop culture historian. “But she often seemed hired to smolder, like a prop rather than as a fully developed character.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Yvonne-De-Carlo-The-Munsters-Lily-Photos.jpg><p class=p1>Not only did her career stall prior to <i>The Munsters</i>, but Yvonne was also having trouble at home. Her husband, stuntman Robert Morgan, had lost his leg — and nearly his life — when he was run over by a train while filming 1962’s <i>How the West Was Won</i>. The couple, who had three children, were buried in medical bills. But there was a silver lining. “Before the accident,” Yvonne said, “we were on the verge of breaking up, but when they took me to the hospital … I just choked up and only one thought filled my mind: I don’t want my husband to die.” They would stay together until 1973.</p><p class=p1>Although <a href=#>Lily Munster</a> cast a long shadow, Yvonne made a splash on Broadway in 1971, belting out the survivor’s anthem “I’m Still Here” in Stephen Sondheim’s <i>Follies</i>. The actress, who died in 2007 at 84, also kept acting into the 1990s.“</p><p class=p1>Despite everything she did, people know her for just a couple of roles,” <strong>Frank DeCaro</strong>, author of <i>Drag: Combing Through the Big Wigs of Show Business</i>, points out. “But because she got these home runs that are so spectacular, it’s enough for her to be in your heart forever.”</p><p class=p1>— <i>Ed Gross</i></p><p class=p1><b>For more on this story, pick up the latest issue of <i>Closer</i> magazine, on newsstands now.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46yraimnpp6pbGMnJirpJ9ivLex0ZyYpp1dmK6zscSrZK2qn6qvrbGMmqWdZZ2Wv6rAwKVksKeVqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
