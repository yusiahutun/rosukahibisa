He starred in classic productions, including The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland in local theatres, per his IMDB. After a year at the American Musical and Drama Academy, he dropped out to audition for off-Broadway shows.</p>It turns out that the actor was a natural talent, and he managed to catch his big break in 2011 in the world premiere of the play Newsies. He then progressed to star on Broadway in 2016 in Dear Evan Hansen, which earned him a nomination at <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the Tony Award</span></a> for best in a feature role in a musical, portraying the character Connor Murphy.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/26/4cda46dd-3db5-4142-92ef-b7906d5252ce_7f1d0f22.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Ohio native made his debut across the Atlantic in London’s West End in 2023, starring as Jack Twist in the stage adaptation of Brokeback Mountain.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">He can sing … but is less confident about his dancing</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/26/0c1e0d9b-c887-45e2-a65f-dbe982bc5470_a0d2a91b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having studied at the American Musical and Drama Academy, albeit for just a year, it’s no surprise the actor is just as good a singer. His vocal talent came in handy when he joined the cast of Steven Spielberg’s film adaptation of West Side Story. Playing Jets leader Riff, his performance nabbed him a Bafta nod for best actor in a supporting role.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Meet Henry Cavill’s family – including his 4 lookalike brothers, and parents</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While he’s belted a tune or two for roles, he hasn’t been as confident about his dancing. Despite having taken dance lessons as a kid, he hesitated to dance during the audition for West Side Story. In an interview, he shared, “I’m not good enough. I had no business being in that room, quite frankly. These were some of the best dancers in the world.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Spielberg however, did not quite agree. The director called him “one-of-a-kind” and reportedly said, “He can do absolutely anything.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">He had to learn tennis for Challengers – and it was hard</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/26/edfd46ad-e1ee-46ce-826f-024f44910fda_a26c17fe.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a recent interview with GQ to promote Challengers, in which he plays a tennis pro, Faust shared that he had to learn the sport from the ground up. He revealed that he was on his high school’s tennis team for a season after failing to get into the school play.</p>Still, getting the hang of the game enough <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">to portray a tennis pro</span></a> was no small feat. “It did not come easy. There’s a lot of work, and that’s just part of the job. The one thing that excites me as an actor is the ability to dive all the way in and immerse yourself in a world,” he shared on the red carpet at the Challengers premiere.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqmdn6W5pnvCnqOemqKewaqx0miYq6yZmLmme5JrbWltYGx8uLTOZqSio5Vis6K10q1ks52ema66rdJmmqhlo6mus3nNnq5mnpmhum6vx5qjpZ2enLKzv4yao6iml6i2pbGMo6asoF2ksLC6zaipZq%2BVqMFuv8idnGarpKS%2FunnAnKuoqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
