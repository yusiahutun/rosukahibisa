While that’s not too shabby, the instant popularity boosted them to $40,000 per episode for season 2 — or about $960,000 for all 24 episodes.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_editorial_10609709a.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Ahead of season 3, the six main cast members decided to band together to negotiate, and their gamble paid off.

She and the rest of the cast negotiated that they would earn royalties off of the show being sold into syndication.&nbsp;<i>Friends</i>&nbsp;generates about $1 billion per year in syndication royalties, so it’s safe to say Courteney and the rest of her costars are raking in about $10 to $20 million in royalties every year.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>How Does Courteney Cox Make Money?</span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>While&nbsp;<i>Friends</i>&nbsp;was Courteney’s golden ticket, she has plenty of other acting credits under her belt.
