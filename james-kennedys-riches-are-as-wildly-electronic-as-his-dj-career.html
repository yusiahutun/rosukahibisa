As many already know, going on a Bravo reality TV show pretty much sets someone’s career up for life."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After all, it has been years since he first made an appearance.</p>BridTV4695Vanderpump Rules | Season 9 First Look Trailer | Bravohttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/5kL6EYPdGBY/hqdefault.jpg856408856408center22403<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-james-kennedy-s-djing-career>James Kennedy’s DJing career</h2><p>With a skyrocketing career, James is pretty much booked up for most weekends. From playing at Rise Rooftop just days ago, to being so proud of his work that he uses his real name, it’s all looking up for him.</p><p>He used to call himself “White Kanye” before deciding he would be “officially retiring” the moniker which pays tribute to&nbsp;Kanye West, as reported by <a href=#>Bravo</a>. He announced he would release his first remix in late 2020, through a major label.</p><p>James is so motivated that he even hopes to work with Kanye himself in future. But he doesn’t forget to include his co-stars. Lala Kent features on his No. 1 track “Feeling You”, while Max Vanderpump is on his Pump Sessions&nbsp;single “Sevii.”</p><p>Plus, it’s all down to his own success, because he never needed Vanderpump Rules to make him famous. This is because his <a href=#>family</a>&nbsp;has been linked to legendary George Michael.</p><p>The Bravo star knew the musician as “Uncle George” growing up, as he was best friends with his father Andros Georgiou while living in London.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@bravoproducer</a> we need to see more parties with dj James Kennedy next season.<br>I want this cast back at SUR!

The producer is thought to make his main source of income from his producing stints!</p><p>While some reality TV stars may rely on brand endorsements or Instagram influencing deals, James has stuck to his passion for making music. Most weekends, he appears to be getting the crowd dancing and on their feet.</p><p>Although he came to fame on the show, it’s only helped to increase the number of people in the audience, and therefore raised his net worth even higher over time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I WAS SHOOK WHEN JAMES SAID THAT AS RAQUEL GAVE HER RING BACK <a href=#>#PUMPRULES</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/98tiG7e5nc</a></p>— bravostanhan (@BravoStanHan) <a href=#>January 26, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-james-gets-a-hefty-bravo-salary>James gets a hefty Bravo salary</h2><p>James is reportedly paid between $10,000 to $15,000 for filming just one episode of Vanderpump Rules. The salary means that over a season, he is gaining an income of around $170K!</p><p>Add onto that the price of Raquel Leviss’ engagement ring, which she swiftly returned on the Season’s reunion. James responded by saying the jewellery piece may be equivalent to a Bitcoin.</p><p>The cast was allegedly paid&nbsp;$5,000 per episode&nbsp;for the entire first season, according to <a href=#>TMZ</a>. This was reportedly up by $3,000 per episode for Season 2 (about $51,000 for the season), then $5,000 per episode for Season 3 ($63,000).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by James Kennedy (@itsjameskennedy)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p><strong>Contact: Celine Byford – <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=452620292c2b206b273c232a3721052237336b2820212c24>[email&nbsp;protected]</a></strong></p><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH VANDERPUMP RULES REUNION PART TWO TUESDAY 26TH AT 9/8C ON BRAVO</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfo7K4v46jmKado2K4prrNnpuyq12ntqS0xKxkmqqVYq60edaio52kqWKyrbHCramoppmYeqK%2FjKGgrGWUn3qkrdGenKs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
