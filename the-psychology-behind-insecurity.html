Suddenly, you begin doubting your very own look and feeling insecure. We have all been there – insecure about our looks, our personality, our social reputation, or even our relationships. Insecurity includes a lack of self-assurance that may have large personal, emotional, and social effects. It can make us feel uncertain and wonder about our very own well-being.

It can arise from various reasons along with childhood reports, societal pressures, and personal insecurities.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Childhood Experiences:</h5><p>Often, our early relationships and stories from our feelings of self may contribute to feelings of insecurity. Additionally, Society has a tremendous effect on our perceptions of ourselves. It leads to the person being confused, which further makes it tough for them to form relationships with others, and cannot manage their emotions effectively. If there is a lack of security of attachment the child may find it difficult to trust others, safe feeling in their environment. Another factor could be the over-critical parents.

If individuals live in a competitive environment, then they may feel inadequate. Cultures where people think that materialistic things and possession of something can help to uplift your status in society, and when people are not able to meet these expectations then they may feel insecure and self worthlessness. Gender roles and discrimination are other causes of social and cultural factors. Because in our society, there are some unsaid roles and sets of expectations for genders. Boys and girls have to behave in a certain way. However, when they don’t meet these expectations or not being able to meet their gender role standard, then the feeling of insecurity comes into the picture.</p><p>Apart from these gender roles, discrimination also causes insecurity. When a person is discriminated against they may feel that they are not good enough or not worthy of value and start feeling inferior to others. Competition and social comparison are very common causes of developing insecurity. As when there is constant competition people may feel that they’re not enough and start feeling a lack of motivation.

Being a perfectionist in every task can be harmful to them because whenever they can’t do a task with the set of expectations they’ve put on this can make this individual feel worthless. This way they won’t be able to see their own good side and always compare themselves with others. Not only are they being perfectionist, but also sensitive to criticisms can also cause insecurity. Another personality trait is that they are very sensitive to criticism. This sensitivity of criticism can cause insecurity and people can see themselves in a very negative manner. Whenever these people get criticisms about their work, they take it personally and feel like people are attacking them.

Whenever this insecurity happens, the person cannot trust their partner fully. They believe that they are not good enough for themselves or any lesser than others. Moreover, people start feeling jealous, and possessiveness and it leads to arguments, fights, and a lack of communication between the two parties.

They cannot trust their own actions and hence constant validation from others. They always ask others, whether they’re making the right decision or not, or what others will think about them. This will make them not take any opportunity because of the risks it may have and the fear of failing or rejection is always with them. Their life will not be theirs anymore.
