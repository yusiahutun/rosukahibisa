To finish off her outfit, the royal pinned a symbolic red poppy to her outfit and added Giuseppe Zanotti red heels and diamond drop earrings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/05e318985761-meghan-markle-red-dress-prince-harry.jpg><p id=eCznv4c8hmT data-wc=37>Beauty-wise, the former Suits actress ensured the attention remained on her dress by wearing her raven hair in a sleek high bun and keeping her makeup simple with radiant skin, long lashes, winged eyeliner and nude lips.</p><p id=eai4hVjZRy6 data-wc=30>The Duchess' outfit may have been deliberately chosen to <a class=hm-link href=#>represent her "dominance"&nbsp;</a>and "power" after she admitted she kept her wardrobe very neutral while making appearances with the royal family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d1742d33f3a0-meghan-markle-dress-back.jpg><p id=eNJgKSOxHf1 data-wc=28>Body language expert Darren Stanton on behalf of<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;Betfair</a> said red is "an extremely powerful colour, one that denotes being supremely confident and is often associated with superheroes."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eZM3ooLEZfA data-wc=74>This marked a rebellious departure from royal style rules, which dictate that hemlines should be below knee length, necklines should be modest and shoulders should be covered. Meghan regularly adhered to those rules as a working member of the royal family, stepping out in everything from a beige coat for her first Christmas with<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Harry</a> at Sandringham in 2017 to a blush pink capped-sleeve Prada dress for the Queen's Young Leaders Awards in 2018.</p><p id=eOL19sbHaEq data-wc=72>"Most of the time that I was in the U.K. I rarely wore colour," she explained on their Netflix docuseries. "To my understanding, you could never wear the same colour as Her Majesty if there's a group event, but then you also shouldn't be wearing the same colour as one of the other more senior members of the family. So I was like, 'Well, what's a colour that they'll probably never wear?'&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/97daad36909a-meghan-markle-red-outfit-z.jpg><p id=ejSdjUzItTUY data-wc=47>"Camel, beige, white... so I wore a lot of muted tones, but it was also so I could just blend in.
