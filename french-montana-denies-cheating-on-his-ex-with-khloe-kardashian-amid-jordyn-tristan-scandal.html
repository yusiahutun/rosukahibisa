Jordyn, who used to be best friends with <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>, has been accused of hooking up with Khloe's baby daddy while they were still together.

He tweeted, "Did Khloe Kardashian start dating French Montana when he was still with Trina? And wasn't Khloe friends with Trina???"</p><p>The subject came up again on Friday, after the interview was released on Facebook Watch. During the talk, the 21-year-old model claimed she wasn't the reason Khloe and Tristan split, something which set off Khloe on social media.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Remember when you started dating <a href=#>@FrencHMonTanA</a> while he was still with <a href=#>@TRINArockstarr</a>, your former friend? I do! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yzBxPmq2bj</a></p><a href=# rel=noopener>@ThePerezHilton</a><p>"Why are you lying @jordynwoods??" she tweeted. "If you're going to try and save yourself by going public, INSTEAD OF CALLING ME PRIVATELY TO APOLOGIZE FIRST, at least be HONEST about your story. BTW, You ARE the reason my family broke up!"</p><p>"Tristan is equally to blame but Tristan is the father of my child," Khloe added in another tweet. "Regardless of what he does to me I won't do that to my daughter. He has been addressing this situation PRIVATELY. If Tristan were to lie publicly about what conspired, then yes I would address him publicly as well."</p><p>Perez responded to Khloe and brought up French and Trina: "Remember when you started dating @FrencHMonTanA while he was still with @TRINArockstarr, your former friend? I do!"</p><p>While she has yet to comment, Montana finally reacted to the messages on Friday night, responding to Perez's initial tweet by writing, "I was single like a dollar bill." Trina also alluded to the situation <strong><a href=#>on her Instagram</a></strong>, posting a photo of herself with the caption, "Minding the business that pays me."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I was single like a üíµ dollar bill üôè <a href=#>https://t.co/UaQU0fC1FP</a></p><a href=# rel=noopener>@FrencHMonTanA</a><p>Montana's tweet didn't go over too well with a lot of his followers, who were clearly skeptical about his response -- see some of their shade below:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Trina said she's minding her business but you know the internet never forgets. She said on The Breakfast Club she found out about you and Khloe dating online while still living in the house y'all shared together in the relationship she thought y'all was still in.</p><a href=# rel=noopener>@LightBrightWill</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Same way Tristan was single üòòüòòüòòüòòüòò</p><a href=# rel=noopener>@mdaixo__</a><p lang=und dir=ltr>üòè <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/VIHUWdFYwG</a></p><a href=# rel=noopener>@ElishaBenson4</a><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4ZWZHRqFsr</a></p><a href=# rel=noopener>@nirvanak_</a><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OTaDjJDC3q</a></p><a href=# rel=noopener>@isagatious</a><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gKJrH9RNg8</a></p><a href=# rel=noopener>@whittles06</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Now French you didn't have to respond at all.
