I don't know what the deal is, but I would really like to figure out what it's like to be married first, and I know he would too." She adds, "Sometimes I know God laughs at your plans, and says, 'Nope,' but it's definitely not in ours any time soon. So, no babies." Last year, she also told <a href=#>Self</a>, "Two is good. Three is fine. Four? Somebody’s getting something done, because we ain’t having five!”</p><p>Underwood also told Nashville's WSIX that she made a "baby pact" with her girlfriends. They all agreed to try and get pregnant at the same time, so they can support each other by sharing baby-rearing responsibilities.</p><p>As <a href=#>previously reported</a>, the 27-year-old is anxiously awaiting the April 8 release of her big screen debut in 'Soul Surfer,' which is the story of teenage surfer and shark attack victim Bethany Hamilton.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnJmip7amedSnm56qp6S8pXnNqKtmqKKatK%2Btza1m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
