I was asked in this situation numerous times for permission to use my song; in each instance, politely and in a timely manner, I unequivocally said no. Apparently, Ms. Minaj chose not to hear and used my composition despite my clear and express intentions,” Chapman said in a statement provided to CelebrityAccess.</p><p>“As a songwriter and an independent publisher, I have been known to be protective of my work.&nbsp; I have never authorized the use of my songs for samples or requested a sample. This lawsuit was a last resort—pursued in an effort to defend myself and my work and to seek protection for the creative enterprise and expression of songwriters and independent publishers like myself,” Chapman added.</p><p>Minaj never formally released “Sorry” but instead provided it to popular New York DJ Funkmaster Flex, who played it on his Hot 97 radio show.</p><p>In September, a federal judge ruled in a summary judgement that the use of the sample in the song constituted fair use to enable music experimentation, noting that a ruling against the use of such sampling would “limit creativity and stifle innovation within the music industry.”</p><p>Edit: This article was updated to correct details regarding the court ruling.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ35wfJBoZ3Fnopq9sL7TZqWim5ueeq61zZqhZquVqcGtsdJmrqKsmGLBs63CsmScoJGluqK6jKitnqpdlrmtscaem2abn6XGs7XGoatmoZ6bv6q6xp6knqakZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
