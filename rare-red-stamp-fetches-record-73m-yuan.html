The stamp's sale accounted for more than a third of the entire auction.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mao's government issued the stamp - measuring 6cm by 4cm - to celebrate the revolution's 'complete victory', even though the movement would continue until the chairman's death in 1976.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It remains one of the most well-known rare stamps issued by the government and only eight are believed to have been preserved. The image features a map of China, painted red to show the 'revolutionary committees' that were then set up all over the mainland. Notably, the whole map is red, except Taiwan, which, like today, was run by the Kuomintang.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The design, which was printed by the Beijing Stamp Printing Factory, also depicts peasants and soldiers holding Mao's iconic 'little red book' of quotations. Red flags of revolutionary committees and crowds of peasants and soldiers' marching triumphantly fill the background.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The slogan 'Long live the victory of the great Cultural Revolution' is written across the bottom.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'It is brand new, rich in colours and in good condition,' said Guo Xueguang, China Guardian's general manager for stamp and coins. 'The record price reflects its scarcity and the fervent attention from the collectors.' The stamp is especially rare because it was a second version of which only samples were printed for leaders' approval. The first design featured images of Mao and his right-hand man Lin Biao against the backdrop of flags, slogans and people.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was ordered to be withdrawn and destroyed after top leaders changed their guidance on publicity to require less usage of leaders' images and quotations, said Zhu Tong, vice curator of the China National Post and Postage Stamp Museum in Beijing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhu said the stamp's designer, Wan Weisheng, drafted a small number of samples for approval, including the one auctioned last week. The country's then premier, Zhou Enlai , said the stamp was too large and covered too many elements.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A third, smaller version of 'The Whole Country Is Red' - this one 4cm by 3cm in size - was printed and issued on November 25, 1968. But it was ordered suspended and destroyed, but not before some stamps were sold and passed into circulation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wan told Xinhua the stamps were withdrawn due to an inaccuracy with the map. But it was not, as many speculated, because Taiwan was not red, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'It's not red because there was no revolutionary committee there,' he said. 'Actually, it was a concern that the unclear southwest boundaries might cause cross-country conflicts.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'I was terrified to be accused as a 'counter revolutionary',' he said. 'I didn't expect that I would not be punished. I continued designing stamps until retirement.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wang Banghua, vice secretary-in-general of the China Association of Collectors, said that the stamp was the product of special times.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'That thing which is rare is dear,' Wang said. 'It's not surprising.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The recent auction was not the first time the stamp appeared in the market. It was successfully auctioned for 2.8 million yuan in 2009 and 1.79 million yuan in 2010 by China Guardian, according to artron.net, a mainland artifact archiving website.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This time, both the sellers and buyers of the prized stamp remain unknown because the auction house has kept the information secret.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Where the stamps went between their withdrawal and auction is still a mystery. Wan was surprised to see one at a Beijing auction in 1996 and later told Philatelic Panorama he had no clue where it came from. That is likely because there would have been a risk in disseminating an unapproved stamp.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'It was clearly against the then regulations, especially during the Cultural Revolution,' said Zhu. 'It's why the stamp appeared in the market so late.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The auction value of the bigger version rocketed over past two decades. It sold for 1.4 million yuan in 1999 and HK$3.68 million in 2009, which broke the world record for the highest stamp auction price, the Global Times reported.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Six smaller ones, measuring 3cm by 4cm each, were sold in one lot for more than HK$2.9 million.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China overtook the US as the top auction market in 2010. It solidified that position last year with US$4.79 billion worth of art sold, or more than 40 per cent of the global market, said a report by Artprice, an agency that monitors art sales and auctions around the globe.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">40%</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The mainland's share of global art sales last year, which further strengthened its status as the top auction centre in the world</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdhZX1zfZFpZquZopp6s7HDZqqtmZ2leqex05yfnqtdp7Kku9GdZHBrnWLGtq3N</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
