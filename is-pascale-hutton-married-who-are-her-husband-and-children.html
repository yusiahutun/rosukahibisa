Pascale Hutton is a celebrated actress who has been happily married to another actor for nearly two decades. She has successfully managed her home, marriage, and flourishing acting career.</p><p>Pascale also sees her most popular and regular role of Rosemary in Hallmark’s When Calls the Heart as her leading role as the wife of Kavan Smith.

Fortunately, both are happily married, but to different people. Born in British Columbia, the actress married Danny Dorosh in 2002.</p><p>One of the reasons Pascale and Danny have a successful and beautiful home is that they have been able to keep their private lives largely away from the media. They take care to keep the negative energy away from their family and children, which was a good thing.</p><p>In an interview, Pascale Hutton revealed that she has known Danny since her teenage years and that they met at the age of 19. She revealed that Danny told her confidently that he would marry her one day. She was really shocked by his boldness, but soon she found herself in love with him. Four years later, when Pascale was twenty-three years old, they sealed the covenant in a beautiful ceremony attended by her family and friends.</p><p>Furthermore, Danny as Pascale proved to be a worthy and supportive spouse who only started acting after his marriage to make a successful acting career. According to Pascale, without the support of her husband, she will not have the success she has today. She describes him as “the most incredible man in the world”. The couple lives in Vancouver, British Columbia.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What You Don’t Know About Pascale’s Children</strong></h2><p>Pascale has successfully separated her professional and private life and seems to be happier with her condition. She supports all her projects, but she prefers to keep her private life out of the public eye.</p><p>For example, she was surprised when she took part in the “Awesome Challenge” with her two children in 2018 and posted a picture of them pampering their cheeks with kisses. People wondered when and how she could keep this message under wraps. While there was a rumor in 2014 that she was pregnant, Pascale never came out to openly dispel or confirm the message. Her second son was welcomed on May 14, 2015, while her first was born four years earlier.</p><p>In a rare move, Pascale Hutton spoke in an interview about juggling motherhood and her acting career. She revealed that she has learned to set priorities because she loves her family but also wants to work. She admits that she always feels a little cramped when she has to go to work.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Jay-Z’s Height, Weight, And Body Measurements</a></strong></p><p>In a regular year, she goes to locations for about 5 to 6 months and then has the rest of the year to concentrate on her family. She also admits that her husband and nanny have a great support system that helps them balance their household when work is really hectic. Her husband was very practical and present in raising her sons. Pascale revealed that the boys love him very much and consider their father the best man who ever walked the earth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Pascale-Hutton-2.jpg><p>Pascale also admits that motherhood has changed her. She used to travel a lot to work before the children arrived, but now she finds working closer to home more attractive because she believes there is no substitute for being a parent.

This is one of the reasons why she strives to be present in the education of her children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Quick Facts About Pascale Hutton</strong></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody readability=3.5><tr><th>Date of Birth:</th><td><span class="value birthday">14 June 1979&nbsp;</span></td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-adjust"></i>&nbsp;Age:</th><td>40 years old</td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></i>&nbsp;Birth Nation:</th><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-tower"></i>&nbsp;Height:</th><td>5 Feet 6 Inch</td></tr><tr><th>Name</th><td>Pascale Hutton</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>Canadian</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place/City</th><td>Creston, Canada</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity</th><td>White</td></tr><tr><th>Profession</th><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth</th><td>$1 million</td></tr><tr><th>Eye Color</th><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><th>Hair Color</th><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><th>Weight in KG</th><td>56</td></tr><tr><th>Married</th><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><th>Married to</th><td>Danny Dorosh</td></tr><tr><th>Education</th><td>University of Alberta</td></tr><tr readability=4><th>Online Presence</th><td>Facebook, Twitter, Instagram</td></tr><tr readability=3><th>Movies</th><td>The Art of War II: Betrayal,&nbsp;S.W.A.T.: Under Siege</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ktrR5z5qqnJmcmnqpwdOtpqdlnZa%2Fs7XEnWSwoJ9irrOxjKGcq2WYqsCjrc2dZJqmlGKwqbXLnamepl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
