So far the sisters have discussed everything from what it's like to be followed by the paparazzi to dealing with mental health issues and even got the chance to interview their parents!</p><p>Ahead of the launch, Charli and Dixie explained that they were thrilled for their fans to get to know them beyond their seconds-long TikTok videos, <a href=#>saying</a>, "We're so excited to share what's happening with us and our family since this all started. Most of what we share is less than a minute long -- usually seconds -- so it's actually gonna be fun to be able to talk with our fans and break down everything going on in our lives."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2a21b0ca-37ea-4d0c-a346-067e21874f8f data-container-ref=toofab:article:347d86f0-2300-4628-affa-846eb681ebc8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/da/5by4/2021/03/08/da15e70706b946e7b27806e694389e4a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">TikTok Stars Open Up About Their Mental Health</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Addison Rae</strong></a></p><p>Back in July of 2020, Addison Rae took a leap into the world of podcasting alongside her mom <a href=#>Sheri</a>. In the mother-daughter project, titled "Mama Knows Best," the duo talks about relationships, friends, family and growing up. Of course, Sheri also dishes her best advice about dating, dealing with rejection and learning to drive.</p><p>"I think a podcast is like another level of intimacy with your supporters. Being able to talk about it with my mom too is so fun. We definitely have awkward conversations. People are like, 'How are you so close?' And I'm like, 'It wasn't always like that!' Obviously, with moms and daughters, there are boundaries and things you don't tell your mom but now I’m telling her everything!" Addison said on <a href=#>"The Ellen Show."</a></p><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Josh Richards</strong></a></p><p>Last year, Josh Richards teamed up with <a href=#>Barstool Sports</a> founder <a href=#>Dave Portnoy</a> for a new podcast called "BFFs." The unusual pairing merges the duo's drastically different audiences as they offer their opinions on everything from TikTok drama to running a media empire. So far, they've featured guests such as <a href=#>Nessa Barrett</a>, Bryce Hall and <a href=#>Tana Mongeau</a>.</p><p>"It's not every day that a pairing like this is forged where we can have a podcast resonate with so many different audiences. Dave is amazing at what he does and is -- without a doubt -- the greatest to ever do it," Josh said in a statement ahead of the podcast's release.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:805a32bd-de4a-4212-94c5-e26dcaab2516 data-container-ref=toofab:article:347d86f0-2300-4628-affa-846eb681ebc8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6b/5by4/2021/02/23/6b0008f4212b4abd981ca5f83eab9619_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Josh Richards Talks Mark Wahlberg Partnership, Emmy Nominations, and Sway House (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=#><strong>Bryce Hall</strong></a></p><p>Bryce Hall recently launched his podcast "Capital University" in an effort to help content creators and entrepreneurs get and stay wealthy. With the guidance of notable investor Anthony Pompliano, the duo chats with finance experts about investment strategies, different ways to earn money as an influencer, and how to build generational wealth. Bryce was inspired to start the podcast after going "completely broke" and wanting to help fans who may be in a similar situation.</p><p>"I always thought money was an object. I was spending money before I even had it," Bryce told <a href=#>People</a>, adding that he now spends "most of my money on my YouTube videos, it goes into my content."</p><p><strong>5. Indiana Massara</strong></p><p>Indiana Massara, who boasts over four million followers on TikTok, teamed up with pals Zach Justice and Jared Bailey for their podcast "Dropouts." The trio has already recorded over 30 hour-long episodes, in which they discuss life, love, hookups, and even tell some embarrassing stories. Indiana says the podcast allows her to candidly talk about the ups and downs of her life.</p><p>"I think everyone sees the influencers' lives as almost perfect online and they expect them to be that positive, happy role model 100% of the time. My life just isn't like that. I try to keep it real online. Especially on the podcast. That's where I really talk about my life on a week-to-week basis and I am always honest about what I've been going through," Indiana told <a href=#>Seventeen</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fe316c94-4fe3-4d12-9a65-931a12096cd3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:347d86f0-2300-4628-affa-846eb681ebc8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c4/5by4/2021/03/09/c471e3580a7240338ed0730f3b691327_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">TikTok Star Lauren Kettering Denies Animal Abuse, Offers Explanation for Video of Dog with Head Stuck in Jar</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>6. </strong><a href=#><strong>Noah Beck</strong></a></p><p>Noah Beck started a podcast with Josh Richards just so they could talk about their favorite films and TV shows! On "The Rundow‪n‬," the former Sway House members chat with some influential members of the entertainment industry, like "Entourage" creator Doug Ellin. While there are only five episodes of the podcast so far, there's definitely room for the guys to keep the podcast growing! And based on Noah's desire to be an actor, it sounds like a great opportunity.</p><p><strong>7. </strong><a href=#><strong>Max & Harvey</strong></a></p><p>Musical brothers Max and Harvey started their own podcast "School Daze" last November in which they offer their advice and guidance for surviving school. With the assistance of family, friends, and fans, they help anyone who's in school get through the day. They even invite some fun guests including Maisie Peters and Jayden Bartels.

The duo share stories that they’ve never told before and get their guests to do the same! So far, they've been joined by pals like <a href=#>Kio Cyr </a>and JXDN.</p><p>"I'm letting people know who I really am, but more in detail...Even releasing our first podcast, where we talked about our first kiss, I was scared to post because I'm not used to a ton of people knowing my personal life...It's scary to put that out there but I feel like I'm ready to do that," Sofie told <a href=#>TigerBeat</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:19c4cc16-63b0-4653-ad21-2cc7e6a6e153 data-container-ref=toofab:article:347d86f0-2300-4628-affa-846eb681ebc8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c6/5by4/2021/03/05/c65ec02d5da24b80bf4f03fd16a0b700_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Addison Rae Says She Handles 'Some Things Offline' Amid Bryce Hall Cheating Rumors</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>10.
