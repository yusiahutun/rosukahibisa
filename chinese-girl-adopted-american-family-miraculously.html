There, he left the girl with a note written in brush and ink: “Our daughter, Jingzhi, was born at 10am on the 24th day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, 1995. We have been forced by poverty and affairs of the world to abandon her. Oh, pity the hearts of fathers and mothers far and near! Thank you for saving our little daughter and taking her into your care. If the heavens have feelings, if we are brought together by fate, then let us meet again on the Broken Bridge in Hangzhou on the morning of the Qixi Festival in 10 or 20 years from now.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782cRC data-qa=Component-Component>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/11/37a6b0a2-d362-11e7-93d7-6d6fc14be448_972x_131348.JPG><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782vNG data-qa=Component-Component>Dubbed Chinese Valentine’s Day, the Qixi Festival falls on the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar and marks the day when the mythical cowherd and his lover, the weaving maiden, are allowed to see each other on a bridge formed by magpies in flight.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782XwE data-qa=Component-Component>The Broken Bridge – which is not actually broken – is no less evocative. The short span between the shore of Hangzhou’s West Lake and the scenic Bai Causeway was mentioned in an eighth-century Tang dynasty poem. In the traditional story White Snake, it is here that the White Lady and her lover, Xu Xian, first meet.</p><p datatype="p" class="c3 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782gJB data-qa=Component-Component>It wasn’t exactly 10 or 20 years later, but on the eve of the Qixi Festival this year, Qian and Xu finally laid eyes on Jingzhi – their healthy, intelligent college student daughter who is known as Catherine Su Pohler by her American adoptive parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/11/ec8b4d6c-d361-11e7-93d7-6d6fc14be448_1320x770_131348.JPG><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782WlD data-qa=Component-Component>That first sighting was the stuff of reality television. Indeed, a television crew was on hand at the Broken Bridge to capture the scene as Qian and Xu ran to Kati, as she is called by everyone who knows her. The story of how they were reunited is the subject of a BBC docu­mentary that will air this week.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782i6C data-qa=Component-Component>Three months after the meeting, however, it is unclear whether this story of improbable coincidences will have a fairy-tale ending.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782Qf data-qa=Component-Component>“We still feel so much guilt. If we hadn’t abandoned her, she wouldn’t have to suffer so,” says an emotional Qian, when Post Magazine visits the couple at their home in Hangzhou. She is using the Mandarin term chiku, to describe Kati’s life in America. It literally means “eating bitterness”.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782kvC data-qa=Component-Component>Considering the bitterness that the couple have swallowed over the years, it is surprising to find that the stout, kind-looking Qian doesn’t feel more relieved that Kati has grown up in a comfortably middle-class suburban American home.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1017163107828dB data-qa=Component-Component>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/11/f104dcf0-d361-11e7-93d7-6d6fc14be448_1320x770_131348.JPG><p datatype="p" class="dc3_fir c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782a0C data-qa=Component-Component>Baby Jingzhi and the note were delivered to Suzhou city’s children’s welfare institute. Around the same time, Ken and Ruth Pohler of Hudsonville, Michigan, decided to adopt.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10171631078255F data-qa=Component-Component>“We didn’t really think it mattered which country we adopted from but we have a brother-in-law who is Chinese and Ruth’s sister adopted from China, too, which was neat,” says Ken, from the house where Kati grew up, about 30km from Lake Michigan. He and his wife are evangelical Christians with two boys of their own, but they wanted a third child.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782cgH data-qa=Component-Component>In the summer of 1996, 10 American couples were taken by Bethany Christian Services, one of the biggest international adoption agencies for Americans, to the Suzhou orphanage. There, they picked up their new daughters – they were all daughters because of the traditional Chinese preference for sons. As they boarded the tour bus with Jingzhi, the Pohlers showed a translator the note that had come from the baby’s birth parents.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782GRE data-qa=Component-Component>“She was so moved by it, she was in tears while she read it out to us. It was such a heartfelt message,” Ken says. But the couple had no intention of telling Kati about it until she was at least 18, and only then if she showed interest in finding out about her past life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/11/e31efd1e-d361-11e7-93d7-6d6fc14be448_1320x770_131348.jpg><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782JLI data-qa=Component-Component>Kati was brought up as most of the other children were in the town of about 7,000 people. Close-knit Hudsonville is predominantly Caucasian, as is Calvin College, the liberal arts university affiliated with the Christian Reformed Church where Ken is a campus safety supervisor and where Kati is now studying public health and music.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782tqC data-qa=Component-Component>“I had a solid, good childhood,” Kati says. “Everyone knew I was adopted, obviously, so I was never asked about it.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782X0F data-qa=Component-Component>She describes her family as “very religious” and close.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782GLE data-qa=Component-Component>“My two brothers are quite a bit older. I guess if I felt different, it was because I was the youngest and I was a girl,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" class="noindent c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782ITH data-qa=Component-Component>The family albums are filled with photographs of young Kati winning sports tournaments, practising the viola and piano, travelling across America on family and school trips, and generally looking healthy and outdoorsy, wearing a smile that shows off her perfect American teeth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/11/de8760b6-d361-11e7-93d7-6d6fc14be448_1320x770_131348.jpg><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782aOC data-qa=Component-Component>However, like many college students in America, she works the odd shift to earn extra cash, in Kati’s case, in a greenhouse. To Qian, that is awful.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782WL data-qa=Component-Component>“My Xiaochen [her first daughter] here has never had to wash a single bowl,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782JkF data-qa=Component-Component>Qian finds it unbelievable that working part time can be part of growing up in a wealthy country like America.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782X1B data-qa=Component-Component>Equally, Qian and Xu’s experience as migrant workers would seem unbelievably hard to an average American, as would the enormous sacrifices that millions like them have made during their country’s march towards prosperity.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1017163107826eH data-qa=Component-Component>Qian and Xu grew up in Baoying county, near Yangzhou in Jiangsu province – birthplace of the world’s most famous rice dish. Xu, wiry, weather-beaten, with an irrepressible good humour, was born in 1971. He finished junior high school and moved in 1987 to Hangzhou, a five-hour drive away. He was joining millions of others who turned their backs on their ancestors’ farms to seek better-paid work in China’s fast-growing cities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/11/e710f698-d361-11e7-93d7-6d6fc14be448_972x_131348.jpg>The only work the 16-year-old could find was collecting household scraps. But he worked hard and saved enough money to return home a few years later and marry Qian, a fellow villager. The two set up home in a rented room in one of many rudimentary cottages on the outskirts of Hangzhou housing migrant workers. They were so far removed from public services that when Qian went into labour with Xiaochen, Xu had to put her in the back of a delivery tricycle and pedal for miles to the hospital.<p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782UAG data-qa=Component-Component>Still, the couple made the best of things and dreamed of having a better life some day. It was a good time to be in the scrap trade-in one of China’s wealthiest cities; national gross domestic product in the years before the 1997 Asian financial crisis was growing at a staggering 13 per cent.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782QZF data-qa=Component-Component>With their optimism came the idea of giving Xiaochen a sibling.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782kiF data-qa=Component-Component>“We thought we could get away with it since we lived so far away from the family planning cadres in our village,” Xu says. “We thought the sheer size of the city would give us cover.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782s0H data-qa=Component-Component>But they soon learned just how brutal the regime could be. The one-child policy led to more than 300 million abortions, many of which were forced, an unknown number of female infanticides, a terrifyingly efficient spying system and the heavy fines and extortion that served as punishment for those who exceeded their quota.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782iFC data-qa=Component-Component>The decision to give up Jingzhi had nothing to do with the fact that she was a girl, her birth parents say. In fact, they wouldn’t have known her gender when they decided that, given the horror stories they had heard, they wouldn’t be able to keep the baby. By then, Qian was five or six months pregnant and it was too late for an abortion.</p><p datatype="p" class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782FIE data-qa=Component-Component>The couple now own a business selling second-hand white goods as well as a comfortable, two-bedroom flat. But theirs is still a hard life. Xiaochenhas a full-time job but her parents still start work every day at 7am and never take a day off, except over Lunar New Year. They have never even been to Yangzhou, let alone outside Jiangsu province.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782F0H data-qa=Component-Component>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/11/3399411e-d362-11e7-93d7-6d6fc14be448_1320x770_131348.JPG><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782Xq data-qa=Component-Component>Qian runs the shop – a sectioned-off area in a vast, open-air electrical appliances wholesale market that is bitterly cold in the winter. She waits for business as she shuffles between rows of washing machines, flat-screen televisions and refrigerators her husband has acquired and upcycled. It all came as a bit of a shock for the humble couple to find themselves on national television in 2005.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782NrG data-qa=Component-Component>Kati turned 10 in 2005, and Qian and Xu went to the Broken Bridge on the Qixi Festival, as planned.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1017163107820t data-qa=Component-Component>“We got there early, and we carried a big sign with our daughter’s name and words similar to those we used in the original note. We felt like running up to every girl we saw on the bridge,” Xu says. “It was awful.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782B0B data-qa=Component-Component>Nobody met them, and they left just before 4pm, hungry, thirsty and drained by disappointment.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1017163107820yG data-qa=Component-Component>The Pohlers, meanwhile, had asked a friend of a friend to visit the bridge that day.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782BGD data-qa=Component-Component>“We remembered the 10th-year promise in the note,” Ken says. “We prayed about it and talked to a friend who often travelled to China for business. He said he could ask a friend called Annie Wu to try and find the birth parents on the bridge. We didn’t want to involve Kati in something as vague as this. But it was important to us that the birth parents knew their daughter was adopted by a family who love her very much and provide her with a good home.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782KLB data-qa=Component-Component>Wu arrived at the bridge just after 4pm, missing Qian and Xu by minutes. Having checked there were no distressed parents to be seen, she was getting ready to leave when she noticed a television crew filming on the bridge. She asked if they could check their footage to see if anyone who looked like Kati’s birth parents had been there. By sheer luck, Xu had been caught on camera, holding up his sign showing the name Jingzhi clearly.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782kMG data-qa=Component-Component>This was television gold. The station immediately broadcast the story, which the national CCTV network and newspapers picked up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/11/3e16bb08-d362-11e7-93d7-6d6fc14be448_1320x770_131348.JPG><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782fCH data-qa=Component-Component>A friend in Hangzhou saw one of the TV reports and told the birth parents there was news of Jingzhi. The elated couple met Wu through the TV station, and were handed a typed letter from the Pohlers (their names withheld) and some photographs. They were assured there would be further news.</p><p datatype="p" class="noindent c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782yFD data-qa=Component-Component>Unfortunately for Qian and Xu, it was to be a long time before they saw their lost daughter in the flesh. Once they were told of developments, the Pohlers asked Wu to cease contact with Qian and Xu immediately.</p><p datatype="p" class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782I0E data-qa=Component-Component>“We took what we could from Annie, and saw no more need for contact,” Ruth says. “We thought that we should wait for Kati to grow and see if she wanted more information. She’s our daughter. Yes, she has her birth parents but a deeper relation­ship with them would really complicate matters.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782sNB data-qa=Component-Component>Wu changed her phone number and couldn’t be reached by Qian and Xu or the media again.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1017163107820nC data-qa=Component-Component>The couple had no doubt Kati was their Jingzhi. She has her mother’s eyes. Just as an astronomer might scan the skies ceaselessly in search of a signal he picked up once from another galaxy, the couple returned to the Broken Bridge every Qixi Festival.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1017163107829FB data-qa=Component-Component>This is where documentary maker Chang Changfu enters the picture.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1017163107827XF data-qa=Component-Component>“I had made a film about international adoptees from China before and a friend told me about this couple who went to the Broken Bridge to find their daughter,” the Chinese-American says. “It’s an irresistible story.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/11/426aad9a-d362-11e7-93d7-6d6fc14be448_1320x770_131348.JPG><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782tuC data-qa=Component-Component>Chang met Qian and Xu and decided to try to track down the American parents using the little evidence he had: the typed letter from the Pohlers mentioned that Kati had been adopted in Suzhou, that she had rheumatoid arthritis at a young age and that they lived in Michigan.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782ChB data-qa=Component-Component>The internet gods must have been smiling on him, for he chanced upon an online message board on which American parents who had adopted from Suzhou’s only orphanage shared their experiences. One message was from a Ken Pohler, who mentioned his daughter had a knee problem as a youngster. Chang found a photograph of Pohler online that matched the image of the man in one of the pictures Qian and Xu had been given.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1017163107822lH data-qa=Component-Component>Chang made contact but it took him a few years to convince the Pohlers he had no ulterior motive other than to help with any further communication. The Pohlers explained to him why they had resisted stirring up the past, and why they would not make contact with the birth parents the year Kati turned 20.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782y6D data-qa=Component-Component>&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782rbC data-qa=Component-Component>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/11/29cf21c6-d362-11e7-93d7-6d6fc14be448_1320x770_131348.JPG><p datatype="p" class="dc3_fir c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782Ii data-qa=Component-Component>Last year, when Kati was 21, she was preparing for a semester as an exchange student in Spain when, she says, “I thought people there would have questions about me being Chinese and American. So I asked my mother to tell me about my past again, and she said, ‘Well, we should tell you that we actually know who your biological parents are.’ I was so shocked.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1017163107825XG data-qa=Component-Component>Kati knew immediately that she wanted to meet them, but she was also terrified by the prospect, and it took time for her to get over the anger she felt towards her adoptive parents. She felt betrayed for having been kept in the dark.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782VtH data-qa=Component-Component>She got in touch with Chang after telling the Pohlers of her intentions, and agreed to become the subject of a documen­tary about her search for her birth parents. The filmmaker had the heart-warming climax already planned: Qixi Festival 2017; Kati surprising her birth parents on the Broken Bridge. Kati and Chang would meet a few days earlier in Suzhou, to film in the vegetable market where she was abandoned.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782FF data-qa=Component-Component>Withholding this information from Qian and Xu would have been less cruel had the filming had gone according to plan. Unfortunately, Wu – back in the picture after Kati decided to visit China – had tipped off the birth parents. Qian and Xu took themselves to Suzhou to find Kati, only to be told that, for the sake of dramatic effect, the first meeting had to take place on the Broken Bridge. Deeply hurt, the couple had, in fact, been turned away because Kati was feeling overwhelmed by the experience, she tells me.</p><p datatype="p" class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782JLG data-qa=Component-Component>When they finally met on the bridge, Qian broke down and sobbed uncontrollably as the many years of yearning cracked open her battle-hardened shell. This was her daughter’s homecoming.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782GC data-qa=Component-Component>Kati stayed in her birth parents’ flat for two days and shared a room with her sister, who speaks only limited English.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/11/f4d2bd48-d361-11e7-93d7-6d6fc14be448_1320x770_131348.JPG><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782cCE data-qa=Component-Component>“It was really nice to see them. I was surprised by how emotional my Chinese mom was,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782X2F data-qa=Component-Component>Kati was bemused too by the typical Chinese admonition that she received. “The first thing they said was, ‘You are skinny, you’ve got to eat more.’ If I didn’t eat they would feed me. I guess they were just super-excited and missed looking after me for all these years,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782TNG data-qa=Component-Component>The couple took her back to their hometown, and there, Kati met Xu’s ailing mother. She hasn’t spoken since she had a stroke several years ago but she let her lost granddaughter hold her hand. Kati’s grandmother had been there on the houseboat all those years ago to help with the delivery.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782XlB data-qa=Component-Component>Kati admits she hasn’t begun to process the experience.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782prF data-qa=Component-Component>“I want some sort of relationship. I want to see them again. But the big question is, what are they to me? I don’t even know what to call them,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782HZB data-qa=Component-Component>Before her trip, the Asian side of her was purely physical. “Now, it’s deeper than that. It’s good that I am more in touch with where I came from, but it is also confusing. I am a product of where I grew up and that is not Asian in any sense of the word,” she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/11/f83d0a06-d361-11e7-93d7-6d6fc14be448_1320x770_131348.JPG><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1017163107828yB data-qa=Component-Component>For Qian and Xu, seeing Kati doing well was a huge relief and helped to ease the remorse they have been carrying for more than 20 years. But the reunion has also left them hunger­ing for more – and it seems unlikely they will get what they want.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782CzH data-qa=Component-Component>“We were disappointed that she wouldn’t call us mama and baba. We asked her to, but she said they didn’t do that in America, that they called their parents by their first names. Is that right?” Xu asks.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782XoB data-qa=Component-Component>“We couldn’t communicate meaningfully since we don’t speak English and she doesn’t speak Mandarin, but we could tell she’s a really nice girl. But now that we have met her, we miss her even more than before,” Qian says.</p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782k1G data-qa=Component-Component>“I guess we can only tell ourselves she is like a daughter who has been married off.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c6 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101716310782LMD data-qa=Component-Component>To see Kati’s story in full, watch <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0"><span class="c5 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" id=U101716310782PmF data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>BBC Our World: The Return</span></span></a> on BBC World News on December 9 (5.30am, 12.30pm and 7.30pm) and December 11 (1.30am) on Now TV (channel 320), iCable (channel 75) or myTV Super (channel 709).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOpaann12nsqKw0miYq6yZmLmme5FqaWtrYWh8pLTIp5ysnV2ctrO4jJqbqKikmrFurcyeqaKbkaN6p63MoqOyZZ2ev6Kv1KWmrqucrg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
