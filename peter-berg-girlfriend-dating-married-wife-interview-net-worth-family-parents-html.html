In other words, we can say that his prolific career overshadows his personal life. Today, let’s try to get hold of his failed marriage and new dating affairs.</p><h2>Peter Berg’s Unsuccessful Marriage And Family Life:</h2><p>Berge, who is in his early fifties, was married to Elizabeth Rogers in August 1993. When the Peter and Elizabeth fell in love with each other and thought of getting married, Rogers was an agent for Calvin Klein.</p><p>As husband and wife, Berge and Rogers welcomed a son named Emmett Berg in late 90s. The news about Berg’s separation with his wife spread like a wild fire, soon after the pair became proud parents of a son.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As per some sources, Berg got divorced with his wife in 1998. However, Peter is yet to reveal the exact date of their divorce, along with the birth date of their son.</p><p>Earlier in 2014, Berg penned a story for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Time</a>, where he revealed that he doesn’t allow his son to play football anymore. Berg wrote- <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>“Head and neck injuries are what parents thinking about letting their children play tackle football should be thinking about, talking about, and demanding answers about, from any coach presenting himself as a worthy custodian for their child’s introduction to tackle football.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>He also said-</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“Young boys must be taught to play football without leading with or lowering their heads. Young players must be drilled over and over and over with Heads Up Football skills until that skill set becomes muscle memory and second nature.”</p><h2>Spirits Lifted Again To Fall In Love?</h2><p>Who says that a person who has been in a failed marriage can’t fall in love again?</p><p>Right after ending the marital relation with Elizabeth with a divorce, Berg was found <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dating</a> Estella Warren. They dated&nbsp;almost for four years (from 2002 to 2006). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><img alt height=871 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/celebrity/Peter%20Berg%20and%20Estella.jpg width=600 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Caption: Peter Berg pictured with Estella Warren at the Los Angeles Premiere of Collateral in 2004.</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Photo Credit: Ranker</p><p>And in 2012, Peter was rumored to be dating Whitney Cummings.
