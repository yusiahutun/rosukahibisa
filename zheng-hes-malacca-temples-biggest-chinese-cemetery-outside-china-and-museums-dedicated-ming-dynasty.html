During my visit I don’t encounter another soul; not a living one, anyway.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The adjoining temple, Poh San Teng, is busier. It bears one of the two names by which Zheng He is known in Malaysia (the other being the more common Cheng Ho). The 18th-century temple’s grounds are well kept and its facade is decorated by fish murals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/19/352db754-efe5-4a60-a968-e1ca17945b8a_4f6edc75.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/19/83fb238c-b197-4989-8da7-f3eea6372347_9d295f00.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These designs, I learn later at the Admiral Cheng Ho Gallery museum, are inspired by a local folk tale: while sailing to Malacca, Zheng He’s ship was damaged in a storm and almost sank. It was saved by a magical fish, which plugged a hole in the hull, allowing the vessel to reach its destination.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alongside the temple, a path curves beneath willow trees to a gap in a decaying wall, beyond which is the Well of Hang Li Poh, named after the Chinese princess who travelled here in the 1450s to marry the Sultan of Malacca, Mansur Shah.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hang Li Poh brought with her a huge entourage, which swelled the Chinese community Zheng He had established. Historians believe these immigrants are the ancestors of Southeast Asia’s Peranakans, also called Baba and Nyonya, who have a mix of Chinese, Malay, Indonesian, Thai, Portuguese and Dutch heritage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/19/1513ce0e-808e-4434-9ebc-82a2031a63e4_7593d48b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More of this history is explained at the Baba-Nyonya Heritage Museum, housed in a beautifully renovated, 160-year-old Peranakan mansion just south of Jonker Street.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two hundred metres away, the Cheng Ho Cultural Museum occupies a former shophouse on the west bank of the Malacca River which bisects the city’s old town.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It reputedly stands on the spot where Zheng He established a giant warehouse for provisions, money and treasure either plundered or traded by his ship crews as they plied the seas of Southeast Asia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/19/d218a7ff-108f-496e-af3b-885a59dbec50_91d43006.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The city’s most glorious building, the Stadthuys, dominates Dutch Square, which was the heart of Malacca when it was a European colony and is now the hub of its tourist district, full of tour guides, souvenir stalls and cycle rickshaws.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With an earthen-red facade, terracotta roof tiles and white louvre windows, the Stadthuys was built as an administrative centre in 1650. For centuries, what is reputedly the oldest Dutch building in Southeast Asia housed colonial offices.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nowadays it is Malacca’s largest cultural facility, and inside is the small but fascinating Literature Museum, the sprawling and informative History and Ethnography Museum and the aforementioned Admiral Cheng Ho Gallery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/19/a6b0036c-39f4-4a13-bfa1-beb4593e6881_ba0b2b96.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although concealed in the rear of the building, at the top of a flight of stairs, the gallery is well organised. In the main room are paintings of Zheng He, scale models of his ships and artefacts from his time in Malacca, including urns and vases.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Panels in sequence detail his youth, ascent to the rank of admiral and maritime achievements.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One large image of Zheng He shows him dressed in a robe emblazoned with a fire-spewing dragon, his left hand gripping a sword.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/19/6fda0c47-555c-4fe6-b142-933bdc8eec52_3b8f42b7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The depiction could be that of a bloodthirsty invader, yet in Malacca he’s widely viewed as a heroic statesman.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This gallery, run by the Malaysian government, describes Zheng He as a “brave and ambitious traveller” who broadened local culture by introducing Chinese customs, clothing, cuisine, music, dance and religion – much of which is still in evidence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Zheng He first sailed into Malacca, in 1405, it was a fishing village of a few thousand people, only recently founded by Parameswara, a Sumatran prince. By the time of the Chinese admiral’s last visit, in the early 1430s, Malacca was on its way to becoming one of the region’s key trading ports.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The story of Africans descended from 15th century Chinese sailors lives on</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its location on the main sea route between China and India saw a boom in its wealth and influence. Malacca thus became coveted by Europe’s colonial powers, and from the early 1500s, the Portuguese, Dutch and British took turns occupying the city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These Western fingerprints are visible to tourists in the form of colonial churches, forts and mansions. Yet those who dig deeper will learn Malacca was shaped just as significantly by Zheng He and the Chinese.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtncGtkaXy7tMSnnmaglah6rq3LmpqcmV2psq68y56qZpqZnLSmv9NmmqGhnprApnnCnqSerJWnxm671K2qopyVYrCptc2aZJqmlGK6tr%2FErqSsZZSasaqvwK2cnWWdnruoecOypZqrpK4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
