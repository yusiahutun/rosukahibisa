The show offers its own answer: of course not.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And Just Like That… feels like HBO’s attempt at rectifying some of the parts of Sex and the City that haven’t aged well. Framed as a “new chapter,” its message to queer fans, in particular, seems to be, “We’re sorry, and we’re trying to do better.” There are brief moments of clear progress, but overall, it still feels like the show is repeating mistakes from its past.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it comes to LGBTQ+ people, SATC has a mixed legacy. The show premiered on HBO in 1998, when openly queer people were more of a rarity on TV, so giving fans a glimpse into the lives of a small number of LGBTQ+ characters seemed progressive. The problem was, as Cynthia Nixon <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/cynthia-nixon-and-just-like-that-satc-tone-deaf-b1983204.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=surmised class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>surmised</u></a>, “A lot of the LGBT stuff in [SATC] was purely for comedic effect—and now rings harsh on the ear.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">SATC is so fascinating to unpack because what drives a lot of the criticism toward the franchise—its reliance on stereotypes, many of which now feel outdated or offensive—is partly what made it so engaging. Perhaps surprisingly for a show with so many gay fans, which was created and written by two gay men (Darren Star and Michael Patrick King), reductive queer stereotypes were everywhere. Stanford Blatch and Anthony Marantino personified the “gay best friend” trope that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/aug/07/the-gay-best-friend-has-tvs-laziest-cliche-finally-fallen-out-of-fashion data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="once dominated" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>once dominated</u></a> TV and film. Both were immaculately dressed and could be relied upon for bitchy quips, but were rarely afforded much depth beyond embarrassing hookup stories. In the disastrous second movie, they got hitched at a wedding officiated by—you’ve guessed it!—Liza Minnelli.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>The show acts like Carrie, Charlotte, and Miranda have just woken up from a decade-long coma.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Other LGBTQ+ stereotypes were more obviously negative. In Season 2, Charlotte broke up with pastry chef Stephan—a man she initially thought was gay—because he was effeminate. Season 3 saw Carrie embark on a short-lived romance with a bisexual man, which included just about every <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/32021/1/why-were-the-satc-girls-so-weird-about-bisexuality data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="biphobic trope" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>biphobic trope</u></a> there is. In the third season finale, titled “Cock a Doodle Do,” Samantha faced-off with a group of trans sex workers in a portrayal Laverne Cox later <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/laverne-cox-sex-and-the-city-orange-is-the-new-black-my-favorite-episode-1203306932/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=described class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>described</u></a> as “thoroughly othered.” In Season 4, we were introduced to Samantha’s one-time “lesbian lover” Maria, an artist portrayed as hyper-emotional, clingy, and aggressive. The list goes on.</p><p>And Just Like That… has made some obvious improvements in LGBTQ+ representation. Stanford and Anthony were back on our screens together, until the former was written out when actor Willie Garson passed away during filming. We’ve also seen Charlotte’s youngest child (Rock, formerly known as Rose) begin to explore their gender identity. And you just might have seen people tweeting about Che Diaz, the Latinx, bisexual, and nonbinary comedian who ignited Miranda’s queer awakening.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A central problem with And Just Like That… is that the show acts like Carrie, Charlotte, and Miranda have just woken up from a decade-long coma. These women, who were once positioned as forward-thinking and aspirational, seem to have absolutely no idea how to act in today’s world. I’m not convinced that someone who was as switched on as Miranda would be so ill-equipped to navigate basic social situations, or struggle with the concept of Instagram and listening to podcasts. Former sex columnist Carrie now can’t even handle a discussion about masturbation, as if her friendship with Samantha or history of dating men who were into <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/what-is-a-golden-shower_n_587640bfe4b03c8a02d44151 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="golden showers" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>golden showers</u></a> never happened.</p><img alt="This is an image" title="This is an image" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mario-cantone-sarah-jessica-parker-1643308346.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Craig Blankenhorn</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span><p>Mario Cantone and Sarah Jessica Parker as Anthony and Carrie in And Just Like That.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Clearly, the writers want us to see that these women are no longer the boundary breakers they were once characterized as. I’m just not sure how helpful it is to position minority characters as the ones who are tasked with highlighting how out of touch they are, or teaching them the “right” way to behave in “the current climate.” Here, SATC’s penchant for queer stereotypes that are grounded in fairly conservative talking points still lingers, like the idea that LGBTQ+ people are desperate to police everyone’s speech. We see this in the students in Miranda’s grad school class, who are deliberately portrayed as judgmental, blue-haired, and pronoun obsessed—a stereotype that’s often applied to young, liberal people by Fox News and #MAGA YouTubers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">More of this is visible in Che and Carrie’s excruciating podcast, X, Y, and Me, which explores gender and sexuality. The show comes with satirical “woke moment!” and “trigger warning!” sound effect buttons, which are normally followed by Che saying something like “compulsory heterosexuality” or “patriarchal gender binary.” This perplexes Carrie, so it feels like the audience is supposed to relate to these white women as they drown in the ocean of identity politics they’ve been thrown into. Again, this framing feels influenced by culture war narratives that characterize queer people as the tyrannical judge of what’s acceptable to say these days. So my problem isn’t that AJLT is “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2021/12/09/sex-and-city-review-just-like-that-new-kim-cattrall/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="too woke" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>too woke</u></a>,” as it’s been described elsewhere, but more that portraying LGBTQ+ people like this doesn’t actually feel very progressive at all. At times, it’s borderline insulting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The constant focus on Che’s identity makes their character feel particularly unrealistic and tokenistic. We still don’t know much about them apart from that they’re a nonbinary and bisexual comedian who does “a lot of weed” and loves sex. By contrast, we already know much more about the other new additions to the show—even realtor Seema Patel, whom we don’t meet until Episode 4. In some respects, Che seems to be filling the gaps Samantha left behind. A lot of their dialogue seems designed to provoke, or make the other characters seem closed-minded in a way that is reminiscent of everyone’s favorite sex-positive PR maven. In fact, smoking weed, talking about masturbation and bragging about sexual exploits are all behaviors that Samantha was celebrated for 20 years ago. The thing is, having known and loved Samantha for so long, fans have been given an insight into other parts of her character too.</p><img alt="and just like that che diaz" title="and just like that che diaz" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sara-ramirez-cynthia-nixon-0-1643308187.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Speaking of sex, until Che bounded into Carrie’s apartment to finger Miranda in Episode 5, there was a distinct lack of orgasms in a world that used to revolve around loudly discussing them over fancy $20 salads. That scene, where a liquored-up Che and Miranda do the deed while an immobile Carrie pees into a peach Snapple bottle in the next room, will stay with fans for a long time. Still, it’s legitimate to question the circumstances of Miranda’s queer awakening. Why was it written to coincide with her “rock-bottom” moment, where she admits to Carrie that she has a problem with alcohol and is bitterly unhappy? Was “nonbinary sex!” (as Charlotte put it) the consolation prize, or a fun distraction, after the intimacy disappeared from her marriage? Did they make Steve seem so old and doddery to justify Miranda’s actions? And as undeniably entertaining as it was, did that scene really need to be such a cringe-worthy spectacle?</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>All this delving into the minutia obscures the main issue: Che Diaz is extremely annoying. <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All this delving into the minutia obscures the main issue: Che Diaz is extremely annoying. Gawker’s Olivia Craighead thinks Che is “the most annoying person on television,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gawker.com/culture/comedians-are-annoying data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=describing class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>describing</u></a> them as “the most accurate portrayal of a stand-up comedian I’ve seen on screen.” Introducing a central queer character who is a comic might have been a way to counter SATC’s history of making LGBTQ+ people the punchline without their involvement. But it still feels like people are laughing at Che, rather than with them. In fact, after several episodes, “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/heaven_toniight/status/1478044898418958343 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hey, It’s Che Diaz" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Hey, It’s Che Diaz</u></a>” became the defining meme of the reboot so far. The gist of the joke is that Che has a habit of appearing in situations where the audience doesn’t expect (and, quite frankly, doesn’t want to) see them. This is one joke that Che and the show don’t seem to be in on—and a sign that, despite Sara Ramirez’s strong performance, their character isn’t being taken seriously.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Thankfully, in 2022 there’s generally more awareness that it’s not possible for one character to represent any gender and/or sexuality entirely. Che actually made this very point on X, Y, and Me in one of the infamous “woke moment” clarifications.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In AJLT, we don’t have to look far for other LGBTQ+ characters, which is an improvement in itself. We were already getting to know “Stanthony” on a slightly deeper level before Stanford was written out. And the storyline about Charlotte and Harry’s youngest child exploring their gender identity has been remarkably well handled. It would have been much easier to cast Rock’s parents as either fully horrified or completely supportive at the sudden changes in their life. But instead, there’s a mixture of love and bewilderment in their reaction, which feels much more authentic. Charlotte and Harry have shown that it’s possible to be worried, sad, confused, and supportively throw your child a "they-mitzvah" all at the same time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And it’s refreshing to see a portrayal of a young LGBTQ+ person who is buzzing with confidence and creativity, rather than the standard “troubled teen” cliché. At a time when trans youth are under attack and being vilified, it’s an important story to tell.</p><img alt="and just like that sex and the city" title="and just like that sex and the city" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alex-swinton-1643308242.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Craig Blankenhorn</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span><p>Alexa Swinton as Rock Goldenblatt.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What AJLT has demonstrated most effectively is how much our expectations of TV shows have changed. It’s easy to forget that at the turn of the millennium, it was normal for shows like Sex and the City to be apolitical and undiverse. Now, though, fans want more—and, crucially, better—representation. Watching TV is now a participatory process: Social media has democratized the way TV shows are consumed and dissected, providing a real-time focus group where underrepresented voices can make themselves heard.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This shift can be seen in Grey’s Anatomy, a show that premiered a year after SATC ended and is still going. Created by Shonda Rhimes, the show’s cast has always been diverse, but in its early seasons, race was very rarely acknowledged and storylines were not political at all. Former star Sandra Oh <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.primetimer.com/item/Sandra-Oh-admits-being-quot-difficult-quot-on-Greys-Anatomy-says-the-show-didnt-want-to-examine-racial-dynamics-of-Dr-Cristina-Yangs-interracial-relationship-RBSYEd data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>said</u></a> that, at the beginning, the show “would not go into race, and that was purposeful.” But politics and identity issues are now everywhere on the show, from police brutality and systemic racism to the trans military ban. Coincidentally, not only did Ramirez star in the show for 10 seasons as Dr. Callie Torres, but Grey’s just introduced its first nonbinary character, too: Dr. Kai Bartley (E.R. Fightmaster). Unlike AJLT, the show didn’t make a big deal out of Kai’s identity, opting instead to first introduce the viewers to other facets of their character. In its last few seasons, Grey’s has had a mixture of characters across the LGBTQ+ spectrum, with some exploring their identities more explicitly and others who are merely coded as queer. Not only is this more interesting to watch, but it’s a more accurate representation of how queer people actually move through the world.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>AJLT is playing catchup in a TV environment where the norms of minority representation have shifted.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, Grey’s Anatomy had the advantage of moving with the times, rather than taking a decade-long break. But its formula was imitated by the 2021 Gossip Girl reboot, another show that is repenting for the lack of diversity in its first incarnation. The new show is, by its own writer’s description, “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.popbuzz.com/tv-film/news/gossip-girl-reboot-cast-gay-trans-queer/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="very, very queer" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>very, very queer</u></a>.” Yet Luna La, a character played by trans actor Zión Moreno, was only <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.intomore.com/tv/yes-gossip-girls-luna-la-trans-totally-chill/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="revealed to be trans" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>revealed to be trans</u></a> after the first season aired, and her identity hasn’t been explored yet, so there’s a mixture of approaches going on.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">AJLT is playing catchup in a TV environment where the norms of minority representation have shifted. Given that SATC was never known for subtlety, a character as toe-curling as Che is probably what we should have expected. But by handling Rock’s gender identity storyline so sensitively, AJLT has proved that, sometimes, less can be more.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If HBO gives the show another season, which I hope it does, perhaps we’ll get to know Che in a way that feels less forced and intense. There have been brief glimpses into their softer side already, like when they were the only person to offer Big’s secretary, Gloria, a handkerchief as she sobbed at his funeral. Or in Episode 8, when Che told Miranda that they actually do have some boundaries (shocker!) and confessed their love for her. In Episode 5, when Che explained how “Cheryl” (the name they used before coming out as nonbinary) used to “hold everything in,” it made me think that we might come to view them as a very imperfect stepping stone. This isn’t a defense of the current Che, trust me, but given how much the perception of a character like Miranda has fluctuated since 1998, anything is possible with time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I might sound overly optimistic here. But longtime fans of SATC, particularly marginalized people, are accustomed to looking for the best in it—and after the second movie, which ended with Samantha screaming “I have sex!” while throwing condoms at a group of Muslim men, my expectations were low. And the truth is, no one is looking to Carrie Bradshaw’s world as their primary source of learning about sex or identity issues, or even to get their fix of rich white women in crisis. Its obsolescence has never been more glaring.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As the reboot premiered, Ramirez said they hope its approach to queer characters will represent “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.wmagazine.com/culture/sara-ramirez-and-just-like-that-che-diaz-interview data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="progress over perfection" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>progress over perfection</u></a>.” There are brief moments where it has achieved that, but overall, questionable queer stereotypes still prevail. The show is clearly trying to do better this time, but maybe it doesn’t need to try quite so hard.<br></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/b55e39c9-ced9-4e4f-a182-fc83a64ca248_1712601390.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Louis Staples" title="Headshot of Louis Staples" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Louis Staples is a freelance culture writer and critic based in London, UK.
