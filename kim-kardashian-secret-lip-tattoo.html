That's right, Kim -- who famously compared getting tattoos to putting &#34;a bumper sticker on a Bentley&#34; -- has been hiding a lip tattoo since October 2021. She made the big reveal on this week's new episode of The Kardashians, while talking about going to Las Vegas with hair stylist Chris Appleton and his boyfriend Lukas Gage for their wedding."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"This is how you celebrate SNL, with a little tattoo at 4:30 in the morning," she said in the footage.</p><p>Kim also added that since "no one knows" about it and "no one sees it," she also forgets she even has it -- until she sees black in her mouth when sometimes flossing her teeth.</p><p>During the episode, Kim also offered up some marital advice for Appleton and the White Lotus star, the latter of whom proposed with an engagement ring made out of a caviar tin from their first date.</p><p>Giving them "one tip, from a lawyer," she insisted they get a prenup and even offered to write it up for them. They, however, wanted a bit more from her and asked her to officiate the wedding.

She also stressed the importance of communication.</p><p>Following her advice, Kim was asked by a producer how she was doing with her plan of staying single for two years. When reminded she said it a year ago, she said she still had a year to go. "I think that would be really good for me," she added, saying she wasn't looking -- while also admitting, "They seem to find me" when she isn't.</p><p>She was also asked whether she still believed in love -- saying, "Of course, I would be like The Grinch if I didn't.
