One must also do proper research on the best dairy cattle suited in most parts of Kenya, as best dairy cows in South Africa or Europe may not do so well when climatic conditions are altered.</p><p class=align-left>What are some of the things to look out for when selecting good dairy cattle? Well for starters, you need to check the farm records of the cow as most will have characteristics similar to its parents, grandparents or other relatives. Secondly, inspect the udder and go for wide but medium sized udder that is not hanging. This is because teats pointing upwards have enough spacing between them making milking more simple.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs537dv173pjg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to succeed at dairy farming in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Thirdly, examine the legs and ensure that they are strong enough to enable it walk and feed well especially when pregnant. The legs should be straight but wide apart when viewed from behind or front. Moreover, you should never pick a cow with much flesh as the best dairy cow is lean with a long wedge posture that makes it easier for them to convert feeds to milk. Such cows also have longer necks and straight backlines. You should also ensure to buy calm cows as they are easier to handle when it comes to milking them.</p><p class=align-left>There are several key elements to put into consideration for a successful dairy farming in Kenya</p><ul><li>Aptness of the environment; you should examine crucial climatic parameters such as rainfall and temperatures as this will go a long way in determining which breeds are well suited to the specific region</li><li>Supply of feeds; you need to make sure that there is a constant supply of fodder to feed the dairy cattle throughout the year as well as appropriate storage where possible. This is because having enough supply silage is proportional to the amount of milk produced; hence, you need a reliable source for feeds before the animals are even brought to the farm.</li><li>Land space; the amount of land you have will determine the number of dairy cows you can rear.</li><li>Intensity of production; you also need to decide whether to engage in free-grazing or zero-grazing.</li><li>Check whether the desired breed is available as well as its transportation cost.</li><li>Lastly, check the market needs for milk as well as the preferences.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs3cp6vuqhepsg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Large scale rabbit farming in Kenya</span></p></a><h2>Types of dairy cows</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs62a5s9lc3.jpg><p class=align-left>There are five main breeds you ought to know about when rearing dairy cattle. This is because they record the best milk yield throughout the globe. They include Jersey, Brown Swiss, Ayrshire, Holstein Friesian and Guernsey. Most of the small scale dairy farmers in Kenya as well as pastoralists rear breeds like the Sahiwal, Boran, East African Shorthorn Zebu, and Fleckvieh. Locally, the most desirable breed includes the Holstein Freshian commonly referred to as Freshian. However, most of the farmers invest in dairy farming without knowing the basic information regarding the type of breeds or their advantages and disadvantages. For this reason, it is recommended to have some dairy farming training in Kenya before committing any of your cash into the venture.</p><p class=align-left>The Freshian breed has features that include short horns, mature cows weigh approximately 500-650 kilos, have black and white markings om them while in some few cows it could be white or red, and are hump less. The reason that the Freshian is considered the best dairy cows in Kenya is that out of the five best breeds, it yields the highest milk quantities per lactation. An ideal dairy cattle produces roughly around 8,500 to 10,000 kiloliters of milk per annum while a good Holstein Freshian cow is presumed to have 12 to 15 lactation. To add, the cow’s milk has the least butterfat content roughly between 2.5 – 3.6% and 3.2 % proteins as compared to the other four main breeds. In a generation where most of the population cares about the calories in their diet this is of utmost importance.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs438ju17rc59.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is pig farming a good business?

Firstly, you need modern methods of storage for animal’s feeds as this ensures that the animals will be feed throughout all seasons. Napier grass just like fermented maize crops is a rich source of nutrients and so farmers with no access to maize plants can feed Napier grass to their dairy cattle after chopping them into smaller pieces. Fermentation of silage assists in reducing the amount of energy the cattle will consume in producing milk.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs23mm2ug3g68.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dairy Farming in Kenya: How to Succeed in This Lucrative Business</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Additionally, calves need to feed on milk during their first six weeks as this enhances their growth and development. This should be accompanied by a reduction of the quantity of milk they are feed on and it will help the claves adapt to eating new feeds easily.</p><h2>Silage making for small scale farmers</h2><p class=align-left>Silage making is the process of digging or constructing storage pits to compress green crops. Silage making is practiced by large dairy farmers as it uses heavy and expensive machinery that small scale farmers cannot afford. Silage boosts dairy cow farming in Kenya during drier seasons as it is used to feed dairy cattle thereby ensuring the livestock is feed through all seasons.</p><p class=align-left>Maize is one of the best feeds for dairy cattle as it ensures they produce high quantities of milk. Dairy farmers can plant maize in their farms to be used as animal feeds. Once the maize has matured, it should be cut into smaller pieces to make silage. Afterwards, fermentation needs to be done to increase nutrients that will result to more milk. Other than maize crops like Calliandra and Tricandra are also great option that are rich in proteins. A dairy farmer can also add phosphorus and calcium supplements to feed the dairy animals.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs1rlrfooqa30o.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Banana Farming in Kenya: Make Money Growing Ndizi</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Profitable watermelon farming in Kenya</p><p class=align-left>Below is a clip to encourage you on your journey to successful dairy farming.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dairy farming in Kenya success stories</strong></li><li><strong>Zero grazing dairy farming in Kenya</strong></li><li><strong>How to start dairy farming in Kenya?</strong></li><li><strong>Dairy farming in Kenya: business plan, revenue, and financial benefit</strong></li><li><strong>Challenges facing dairy farming in Kenya</strong></li></ul><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Blm9ncm5dma6qvthmnZqqnZ67qHnKnqWymV2Xwrp5xquYnZ2UYrGitdGyZJynp6h6rLHNsphnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
