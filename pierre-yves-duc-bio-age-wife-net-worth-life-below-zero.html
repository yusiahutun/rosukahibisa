Haha. Stay home and watch <i>Life Below Zero Canada</i>“. He also shared that one of the scariest moments of his time there was when he was chased by an angry bear.</p><p>“Once, while hiking, I found myself between two black bears: a female in heat and an aggressive bear. And the bear did not like me being there. I managed to scare her away, and he followed”.</p><p>And yet, despite the life-threatening encounters, Pierre-Yves didn’t quit his passion for living off-grid. Moreover, he has become a National Geographics TV show star and has returned for season 2 in March 2022.</p><p>On this journey, he is with his best friend <a href=#>Kim Pasche</a>, who relocated to Canada almost a decade before.

The newcomer in this season is Jonathan Grenier from Kuujjuaq, Nunavik in northern Quebec; a man of mixed Inuit and French Canadian heritage and a father of two who is determined to teach his sons how to live off the land in a traditional Inuit way.</p><p>Skill sets and years of experience aside, sometimes natural calamities make their lives even more challenging.

He worked as a sled dog trainer for several years and saved some money. He then bought a trapping concession.</p><p>Pierre-Yves hunts big game of North-West Canada, fishes, and does trapping.</p><p>Later, he founded Call of the Wild Outdoor Adventure, a door that he opened for people who are interested to learn and a platform for him to share his knowledge.
