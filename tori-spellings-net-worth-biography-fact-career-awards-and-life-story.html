S</p><p>pelling claimed to have blown through every dollar she ever made acting or inherited from her late father (an estimated $15 – $20 million). In an interview, Spelling claimed to have blown through millions of dollars on failed real estate investments and lavish purchases for her family. When asked about her exact net worth Tori replied “<strong>I don’t have one million dollars. We had some income here and there, but no savings apart from our retirement accounts.</strong>” To be fair, Tori’s husband Dean clarified her statements the next day by telling US Magazine that “Right now things are going well. Tori and I are doing just fine financially”.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that Tori’s mom Candy is sitting on a cool $600 million. So I wouldn’t stress too much about Tori Spelling’s financial future. But at the same time, in March 2017, City National Bank filed a lawsuit against Tori and Dean after they failed to pay off $200,000 out of a $400,000 loan. City National also claimed that Tori overdrew $17,000 from her checking account. While that lawsuit was going on Dean was also being sued by his ex for $100,000 in owed child support. A few months earlier the couple was sued by American Express for $87,000 in credit card debt and $260,000 in unpaid taxes.</p><p><strong>Early Life: </strong>Victoria (Tori) Davey Spelling was born on May 16, 1973 in Los Angeles, California.
