Bracebridge, and it is as majestic and cozy as the name suggests – it took me a full minute of gliding each time between the master bedroom on the second floor to the kitchen, and then the additional bedrooms below, and I felt fuzzy enough all day long.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f72de6753039-fall-firepit.jpg><p id=ejcL5_QHiRs data-wc=56>On a summer's day, you wake up to the morning sun shining its light on one of Muskoka's thousands of spectacular lakes (specifically Lake Muskoka here) staring right at you, a burst of greenery beyond – but in the winter, it's a white wonderland, right from the frozen lake to the snow cover encompassing your home.</p><p id=e-nzEQV9EX3 data-wc=51>During a good snowfall season, Falcon's Nest becomes its own little nook in the woods, a place to decompress or take in the beauty of a nice cup of tea in the Muskoka Room, a feature several homes in the area have boasting a terrace/sunroom looking out onto the view below.</p><img

dishwasher, Keurig machine, laundry too!), spacious and warm bedrooms, designated communal spaces, books, board games, an outdoor hot tub, AND a fire pit (s'mores, anyone?), who needs to go canoeing in the summer when you can just find an excuse to cozy up inside?</p><p id=ed9nHq8rYWc data-wc=49>And, the best part – like all Vrbo homes, when you book your luxury stay, you get an entire property to yourself, so that massive space is all yours! What's more, you can even plan events at Falcon's Nest, which has hosted weddings, retreats, and all sorts of parties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7bfeb060aa13-ebp-falconsnest22-97-1.jpg><p id=eC7CRl56iWv data-wc=8><strong>Accommodates:</strong> 12 people (6 bedrooms with 5.5 bathrooms)</p><p id=e8gINvcDAmT data-wc=18><strong>Price:</strong> About £1115 per night (£112 per person/per night) OR $1400 per night (est. $140 per person/per night)</p><p id=elCpNWN37sO data-wc=5><span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">vrbo.com</a></span>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a6542b0a2222-muskoka.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>The Activities</h2><p id=el6lAwS0HJZ data-wc=42>Now, if you're the sort to find thrill in exploring your vacation spot, you're in luck – Muskoka has a lot to offer in the summer, with its many water sports, waterside barbecues, and the like. But the winter's no slouch either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4f8adf7805a5-muskoka-winter.jpg><p id=e4SZ6UCQ9ja data-wc=58>If you happen to stop by after a heavy round of snow, then may I recommend dog sledding? Let some of the strongest (and cutest) dogs in Muskoka take you around a trail of the most picturesque scenes in the country on a sled that YOU'LL be driving (spoiler alert: it's not as scary as it seems, trust).</p><p id=eASXao8z2Ysq data-wc=59>But if more low-key activities are your speed, then be sure to hit up some of the charming waterfalls in Bracebridge, or the Muskoka Lakes Farm & Winery for a tour of their massive cranberry farming enterprise (which you can ice skate around), a sip of their multitude of cranberry wines, and, of course, cranberry (and blueberry) themed eats.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3cd7c1f782dc-dog-sledding-muskoka.png><p id=exJITp7CeOhI data-wc=49>If even more low-key is your speed, curl up with a book or movie outside your Vrbo home by the water (or looking out at the water from the window) or book a private massage right in your own home, partaking in one of the area's favorite unwinding rituals.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/83246742fd26-coffee-by-the-window.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>The Food</h2><p id=evAj6ezQ3Nwy data-wc=38>Muskoka and its residents pride themselves on their expert use of local produce. Talking to any one of the area's longtime residents will show you just how much they appreciate living off what the area has to offer.</p><p id=ekSyKbmgt7F_ data-wc=42>The region will not only birth some beautiful wines, but also many herbs and mushrooms, game meat, and who's to forget maple – many residents who grow maple trees in their yards use taps of their own to produce their own sap.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9eba9a6ca3b7-muskoka-cranberries.jpg><p id=eLU98T7xM8XQ data-wc=47>Muskoka also boasts its very own favorite pastry, courtesy of BeaverTails, established in 1978 as the purveyor of the area's favorite fried dough snack, or one of Ontario's signature deep fried butter tarts. Make sure to save plenty of room for them, though, they're not lite bites!</p><p id=e9NCnKWGQWoy data-wc=37>If you're feeling particularly swanky, local private chefs in the area will happily prepare meals for your pleasure in your own home, as we were treated to a seven course masterclass ourselves courtesy of chef David Friesen.</p><p id=eKNM85e00Xa8 data-wc=11><strong>Recommended stops:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Tall Trees</a>, <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Crossroads</a>, <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">That Little Place by The Lights</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/34a5b3e4aeee-beavertails.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Tips</h2><ul><li dir=ltr>If you're going in the winter, bundling up is key!
