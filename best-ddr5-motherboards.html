The solid VRMs are only matched by the beefy heatsinks and comprehensive water-cooling abilities, giving you plenty of overclocking headroom even for demanding CPUs like the 13900K.</p><p>The rest of the motherboard is nothing short of impressive. It features two PCIe 5.0 x16 slots with x8/x8 capability as well as futureproof PCIe 5.0 and PCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe slots, Wi-Fi 6E, RGB, and 2.5G Ethernet.

It's one of the few Z690 motherboards with two x8/x8 capable PCIe 5.0 x16 slots, making it ideal for multi-GPU setups. It also has a qualified VRM for extreme overclocking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Z690 CARBON WIFI is compatible with the 12th Gen and 13th Gen Intel CPUs, but you cannot use DDR4 memory kits on this board, just like with all other DDR5 motherboards. MSI claims excellent memory speeds of over 6666MHz when running one DIMM per channel. There is a 7-segment LED for troubleshooting and a BIOS FlashBack button for updating the BIOS without needing a compatible CPU.</p><p>When it comes to connectivity, there isn't much to complain about. You're getting 10 USB ports, including a 20Gbps USB-C connector, 2.5G Ethernet, optical audio output, and both HDMI and DisplayPort for integrated graphics output from the CPU. It has PCIe Gen4 M.2 slots for faster NVMe SSDs and next-gen Wi-Fi 6E support. Overall, the Z690 CARBON WIFI is a great DDR5 motherboard that should please both casual and enthusiast gamers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h5 class=display-card-title>MSI Pro Z690-A</h5><span>Best Value</span><p class=display-card-subtitle>DDR5 Support on a Budget</p>$190 <span class=regular-price>$210</span> Save $20<p class=display-card-description>MSI's Pro Z690-A motherboard is perfect for DDR5 support on a budget.

It's one of the lowest-cost DDR5 motherboards, supporting DDR5-6400 (OC) memory of up to 128 GB. It's designed for the 12th and 13th generations of Intel CPUs and packs most of the latest features, including PCIe 5.0 and M.2 Gen4 slots.</p><p>The 14 + 1 + 1-phase 55A VRM may not be enough for overclocking nerds, but it can handle the majority of CPUs available today at stock speeds. It has decent heatsinks for the VRM and chipset and offers a couple of headers for fans and water cooling. The rear ports are well balanced with seven USB-A ports, a 20Gbps USB-C port, 2.5G Ethernet, and audio connectors.</p><p>While not a deal-breaker, MSI did cut some corners to keep the price lower. Only one of the M.2 slots has a heatsink, and the IO shield is not pre-installed. Still, if you want to save money and spend it on other components, the MSI Pro Z690-A is an excellent choice for a DDR5 motherboard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h5 class=display-card-title>ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero</h5><span>Best for LGA 1718</span><p class=display-card-subtitle>Flagship performance</p>$660 <span class=regular-price>$700</span> Save $40<p class=display-card-description>Rocking the latest X670E chipset from AMD, the ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero has all the bells and whistles you need to take full advantage of the AMD Ryzen 7000 Series processors.</p><strong class=sub-title>Pros</strong><ul class=pro-list><li class=icon>Capable VRM and cooling</li><li class=icon>Premium build quality</li><li class=icon>Easy overclocking in BIOS</li><li class=icon>Multiple, high-speed USB ports</li></ul><strong class=sub-title>Cons</strong><ul class=con-list><li class=icon>Expensive</li></ul><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$660 at Amazon</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$700 at Best Buy</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$660 at Newegg</a><p>The ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero is one of the most capable AMD motherboards on the market, with PCIe Gen 5.0 for storage and graphics, DDR5, and an overclocking-ready VRM.</p><p>The 18+2 power stages, rated at 110A per stage, can keep up with the insane power demands of the Ryzen 9 7950X flagship processor and other mainstream Ryzen processors.

Fortunately, you do get a PCIe 5.0 M.2 slot, along with three PCIe 4.0 M.2 slots for faster NVMe SSD storage.</p><p>DDR5 memory speeds can go up to 6666MT/s when overclocked, and the 16-phase 70A Vcore VRM can handle the flagship and mainstream Ryzen 7000 Series processors without any issues.
