based on a formula from former Chief of Staff of Kenya Armed Forces Daudi Tonje.</p><p class=align-left>Tonje, who served as the armed forces General between 1996 and 2000, introduced a rotational appointment of military generals.</p><h2>Did Francis Ogolla's death create a vacuum in military command?</h2><p class=align-left>Ogolla is the first Chief of Defence Forces who died while still serving, creating a near vacuum in the military command of the country.</p><p class=align-left>However, Tonje said that the military never has a vacuum, and Ogolla's vice, Kahariri, automatically assumed the CDF office after Ogolla's death.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Addressing the press in his Kitale</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Trans Nzoia</a> home on Friday, April 19, Tonje said Kahariri would serve in the capacity that Ogolla served until the president appointed another substantive CDF.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img

general in accordance with the law," said Tonje.<p class=align-left>His sentiments corroborate with other military officers' assurance that Kahariri began acting as the CDF immediately after Ogolla's death.</p><h2>How many branches does the Kenya Defence Forces have?</h2><p class=align-left>The Kenya Defence Forces have the Kenya Navy, Army, and Air Force, which are mandated to protect the country
