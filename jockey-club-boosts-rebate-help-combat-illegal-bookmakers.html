We were not attractive from a pricing perspective, so we made [changes and introduced rebates]. Our net margin went down. But we had to do it because it was a sure death – we weren’t competitive.”</p><p>This change is the next step in that process.</p><p><img title="Jockey Club chief executive Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges talks to the media." alt="Jockey Club chief executive Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges talks to the media." width=660 height=385 data-resolution=2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/06/11/69f92860-aba4-11ea-bf1b-7541df8028ff_1320x770_153155.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The Jockey Club also unveiled the specifics about the relaunch of the “forecast” for next season.</p><p>The bet type requires punters to select the first and second horses in the correct order in a nominated race. The forecast will be merged with the trio to increase pool liquidity.</p><p>The takeout rate will be set at 19.5 per cent, which means the trio takeout rate will drop by 5.5 per cent, down from 25 per cent and provide more value to customers.</p><p>The forecast, which was last seen in Hong Kong in the 1970s, is a popular bet type overseas in places like the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and is part of the Jockey Club’s strategy to grow commingling revenue.</p><h3><a href=#>Hong Kong Jockey Club to offer punters a bet type last seen in the 1970s</a></h3><p>The thought process is that by providing a bet type overseas customers are more familiar with – and ensuring there is enough liquidity in the market – it will encourage more of those punters to get involved.</p><p>“We believe these changes will provide more value and options for different segments of our racing fans, meanwhile reinforcing deep pool liquidity which is one of the competitive advantages of Hong Kong racing as a global commingling hub,” Jockey Club executive director of customer and international business development Richard Cheung Che-kit said. “More gaming demand will also be channelled back for good causes.”</p><p>The latter point refers to one of the Jockey Club’s charters, which is to serve the community, and as a result it is one of the biggest charity donors in the world.</p><p>After paying its tax obligations, 90 per cent of the club’s annual operating surplus is donated to charity, with HK$4.3 billion going to 294 projects in 2018-19.</p><p>Betting turnover has bounced back strongly in recent weeks – on Wednesday night it was up by HK$186 million on last year’s comparative meeting (with one extra race) – after the disruptions caused by the social unrest in Hong Kong and the Covid-19 crisis.</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dHyXcWxxbl%2BfvKS3xLJknKSll3qju86sq6xlopqvosDEZp%2BepKBisLC5wZqrZqGcobKorctmmainm6KurLHRrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
