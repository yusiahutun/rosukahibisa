If there is no change in the behavior then make sure that you set boundaries and don’t let that behavior define who you are. Accept yourselves the way you are.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Maintain Your Independence</h4><p>When you are in a relationship, it is not that one of your partners is bound to the other permission. You have your own independence and are not needy of your partner. If you see signs like that then try to solve things out.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>1) Keep Up Friendships Outside The Relationship:</h5><p>Sometimes couples fight with each other because of strong friendships outside the relationships. This could be out of jealousy and conflict can start between the two. But it is important to talk to your partner and understand what makes them feel insecure about it. Keeping friendships outside the relationship can make the couple explore and learn different things.

This over-possessiveness can make you lose the privacy that you once had. This includes asking for passwords constantly even after refusing to give them, checking the messages, etc.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>3) Ending Relationships That Are Unhealthy Long-Term</h4><p>It takes a lot to build a relationship, but there would be no use if the other person is not giving respect and even worse when you do not understand your self-respect. Sometimes people stay in an abusive relationship knowing that the other person is bad for them, but still, they manage to keep that relationship because of the unhealthy attachment that they have with the other person. In this whole process, they forget who they are which is harmful to them and makes them suffer from a number of psychological conditions.</p><p>It is crucial to understand the red flags like being over-possessive, gaslighting you, or doing emotional manipulation with you. People who always put you down and make you feel guilty about being yourself could be a threat to you and to your mental well-being.</p><p>Lastly, Making yourself feel loved should be your duty not others. It feels like someone loves you or makes you feel special but not at the cost of your respect and worth. Make self-respect a non-negotiable thing in your relationship.
