A close friend and deputy of the News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks when she edited the paper, Coulson resigned a few weeks before the paper's royal correspondent, Clive Goodman, and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were jailed after admitting intercepting messages on royal aides' phones.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In July of that year, he became the head of the Conservative party's media operation and then communications chief for the prime minister after the formation of the coalition government in May 2010.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>He has always strenuously denied any knowledge of the illegal telephone hacking that is at the heart of the scandal rocking the Murdoch empire.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>When he resigned in January from his Downing Street role, he insisted he had done so because persistent allegations that he must have known that his reporters had been hacking into voice messages had made it impossible for him to continue.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Coulson is one of three News of the World journalists whose evidence to the trial of Scottish MSP Tommy Sheridan is being examined after doubts were cast on his claim that he was unaware of any wrongdoing by News of the World journalists.Evidence leading to the two imminent arrests has come from a cache of emails recently uncovered during News International's internal investigation into phone hacking.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The arrests had been planned to take place before 8 August, when Operation Weeting had agreed to pass all the relevant material in their possession to lawyers acting in the civil cases against News International for victims of phone hacking – thereby giving suspects the opportunity to discover what evidence the police hold against them.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The Guardian understands News International had promised police they would not make public the existence of evidence identifying Coulson and the other journalist, but that detectives began to fear the information would be leaked, after reports appeared suggesting that Coulson approved payments to police officers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaKWVmbaie5FpaGpnmqq5cHyWaJinnKlisLDBy6ymp2WRp7%2Bmv9Nmp6Gnnpp6qa3CpKCnnw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
