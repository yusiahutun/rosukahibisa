I would never dare question her. Queen Charlotte’s word is gospel, so when gossip writer Lady Whistledown threatens to undermine her authority with a gospel of her own, the queen responds with a determination that would force even her precious Pomeranians to tuck their tails and run. Yet, at home, we see a gentler, less assured version of the English queen. As her King George descends further into something akin to madness, her ruthless facade wavers. There’s something gentler, even pained, behind all the pomp and circumstance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of all the larger-than-life Bridgerton characters, Queen Charlotte’s role pulls the most from reality. The queen was, in fact, a real historical figure, and she might have even been England’s first Black member of the royal family. Actress Golda Rosheuvel, who plays the queen, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1376623/Bridgerton-Queen-Charlotte-rowdy-costar-Golda-Rosheuvel-Netflix-latest-news-video data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="describes her as" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>describes her as</u></a> “wealthy, dirty rich, addicted to snuff, devoted to her family, loves gossip and she is divinely in love with her husband who is slowly going mad.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here’s how that holds up to history.</p><img alt="queen charlotte in bridgerton" title="queen charlotte in bridgerton" width=768 height=513 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bridgerton-queen-charlotte-liam-daniel-netflix-3-1610136260.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Liam Daniel/Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Queen Charlotte was quite possibly a Black queen.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although Queen Charlotte’s exact lineage is still debated to this day, some historians believe that she was England’s first Black royal.

Her love for the breed led her to gift Pomeranians to other members of the royal family, and in later decades, her granddaughter Queen Victoria became a famous Pom aficionado herself. She bred the dogs and kept them as near-constant companions, traveling with them and relying on them for comfort after the death of Prince Albert.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Her snuff addiction is documented.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The queen didn’t earn the nickname “Snuffy Charlotte” for nothing. She loved the dry, ground tobacco, and her face was adorned on snuff boxes, which were “as much a definition of status and fashion as the latest mobile phone in the early 21st century,” describes <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/taking-snuff/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="History West Midlands" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>History West Midlands</u></a>, an independent history site reviewed by academics.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Queen Charlotte had <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/whats-on/era-when-pinch-snuff-was-fashionable-700179 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="an entire room" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>an entire room</u></a> at Windsor Castle dedicated to her snuff collection, her favorite of which was named Violet Strasbourg, a blend mixed with bitter almonds, ambergris, and attar.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Queen Charlotte and King George III were truly in love.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although the 17-year-old Charlotte married her husband within only six hours of meeting him, they were fortunate: The relationship was a good one.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Together they had 15 children—a remarkable feat, given infant and maternal mortality rates in the 18th century—and they remained married for nearly 60 years.

The queen was, in fact, deeply involved with gossip around the “ton,” and the first known debutante ball was hosted in her honor. The tradition lasted for decades afterward, up until Queen Elizabeth II canceled the balls in the 1950s.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/18f077ce-19d3-459b-abab-613aa79d9230_1675112119.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Lauren Puckett-Pope" title="Headshot of Lauren Puckett-Pope" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Lauren Puckett-Pope is a staff culture writer at ELLE, where she primarily covers film, television and books.
