Tori and Dean have five children together: sons, Liam Aaron, Finn Davey, and Beau Dean, and two daughters, Stella Doreen and Hattie Margaret. They renewed their vows in 2010, however, their relationship hit a rocky point when Dean admitted to having an affair in 2014. The aftermath of the affair&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>could be seen</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;True Tori.</p><p>In a now-deleted Instagram photo, Dean McDermott announced their separation in June 2023. “It’s with great sadness and a very very heavy heart that after 18 years together and 5 amazing children, that @torispelling and I have decided to go our separate ways, and start a new journey of our own,”&nbsp;he wrote. “We will continue to work together as loving parents and guide and love our children through this difficult time.”</p><p>&nbsp;In court documents obtained by outlets such as<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.eonline.com/news/1398556/tori-spelling-says-shes-never-felt-more-alone-after-filing-for-divorce-from-dean-mcdermott rel=nofollow> E!

The&nbsp;Scary Movie&nbsp;actress asked for sole physical custody and joint legal custody of their kids.</p><p>“I’ve never felt more alone in 50 years,” Tori confessed on her first podcast episode of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>misSPELLING</a>. “I don’t feel worth loving. That’s the truth. And that’s something that’s just in you. It’s not something I wanted or created.”</p><p>“There’s this weird thing that I didn’t know about before that you have to be careful<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1271314/tori-spelling-dean-mcdermott/> with your ex</a>,” Tori explained. “It’s a he-said, she-said, who filed first. I had to file and go through the process and then once it was accepted and publicly posted, then I’m allowed to call and fill in my ex.”</p><p>“We always say, ‘Hey, it made it 18 years,’” she reflected. “It shouldn’t have made it 18 years. I think he would say the same thing if he and I had a real heart-to-heart. It would have been over a lot sooner.”</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=18.67392601432><h2>Tori Spelling's Net Worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tori-spelling.jpg><p>Tori Spelling’s net worth is estimated to be around $150,000 according to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/tori-spelling-net-worth/ rel=nofollow>Celebrity Net Worth.</a> The former 90210, Beverly Hills actress has been open about her inheritance from her producer father and her struggles with money.</p><p>Spelling is the daughter of 90210 producer Aaron Spelling who was worth around $600 million at the time of his death.

The rest was inherited by Aaron’s wife Candy Spelling.</p><p>“I think part of me, in the back of my head, maybe hoped it would be different?

When McDermott’s affair came to light, sources close to the couple revealed how Spelling wasn’t content with the prenup situation. “Dean offered to sign one, but Tori refused. She truly believed Dean was her soul mate and there was zero need for a prenup,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>a source said in 2014</a>. &nbsp;“With the recent allegations that Dean cheated on Tori, she is now kicking herself for not securing the prenup with Dean.
