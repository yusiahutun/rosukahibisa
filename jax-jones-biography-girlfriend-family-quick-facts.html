He gained fame when the song climbed to number three in the British singles charts with Raye.

His Turkish father gave him the name Timucin, and his Chinese mother was also a music enthusiast. Jones also had a stepfather in Nigeria, who introduced him to Afrobeat through the famous Fela Kuti.

After graduating, Jones immersed himself in full-time music. He rented a studio in Sydenham when he was no longer allowed to return to his family home, from where he worked to perfect his talent. That means if anyone knows that nothing good comes easy, it’s Jones.</p><p>Since fate will always give a smile to those who believe in their dreams and work towards them, Jax Jones finally had his break. His newfound interest in house music brought him closer to Duke Dumont in 2014, and together they wrote and produced songs like I Got U, Won’t Look Back and Ocean Drive, all of which were successful.</p><p>However, it paid off to venture into singles, and so he released the single Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah and House Work in 2015 and 2016. And then in December 2016 came the single You Don’t Know Me, which became his biggest success to date, as the song reached third place in the UK and top five in several European countries, including Germany, Ireland, Belgium, and Norway. For Jones, 2017, which followed immediately after the release of the song, was the “best year” of his life. He went to his Instagram page to thank his fans.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Paloma Faith Bio, Baby, Age, Boyfriend, Partner, Husband, Net Worth</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jax Jones Family</strong></h2><p>As mentioned above, Jones’s father is Turkish and he was raised by his Chinese mother and Nigerian stepfather.
