Here are the funniest shows ever, 10 being the funniest: American Dad
Itâ€™s still pretty new, so it really could go up or down. Itâ€™s had some damn funny episodes though.
 Drawn Together
I was late to find this show. I think I just assumed I would hate it, since I have a pretty burning hatred toward the reality genre in general, but this show has some serious bite."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Itâ€™s had some damn funny episodes though.</p></li><li readability=6><p><strong>Drawn Together</strong><br>I was late to find this show. I think I just assumed I would hate it, since I have a pretty burning hatred toward the reality genre in general, but this show has some serious bite. Itâ€™s pretty amazing what they can pull off in this show, I find it much more shocking than South Park, especially the episodes that air late at night where they crank up the swearing and nudity.</p></li><li><strong>Sealab 2021</strong><br>I stopped watching this show after the voice of Captain Murphy died, but in its hay-day (aka Happy Cake) it was amazing. Super weird, funnyâ€¦and amazing.</li><li><strong>King of the Hill</strong><br>Anybody who doesnâ€™t watch this because they think itâ€™s just a bunch of lame redneck humor is missing out. I mean, itâ€™s a bunch of redneck humor, but the characters have a lot of depth. Itâ€™s a family sitcom that hits closer to home than family sitcoms with real people.</li><li><strong>Home Movies</strong><br>Adult swim classic. H. Jon Benjamin knows funny.</li><li><strong>Aqua Teen Hunger Force</strong><br>Probably the most quoted television show ever. Itâ€™s like a whole show of one-liners. Plus I think it takes a lot of guts to characters made of fast food and actually write for it and make it funny.</li><li>strong>Simpsons<br>WTF? Why isnâ€™t this number one? blah blah. I love the Simpsons. It paved the way for anything and everything after it. Itâ€™s had a long and glorious lifetime, but its reign is over. Some of its bastard children are now funnier than it ever was.</li><li><strong>South Park</strong><br>Watching a new episode of South Park for the first time is one of life great pleasures. Never before has a show managed to insult so many different things so perfectly. And they do it so well you have no choice but to agree with them. Plus you always get a little life lesson, which is nice.</li><li><strong>Futurama.</strong><br>Iâ€™m not going to give a big speech. If you have any nerd in you at all, Futurama is king. This show has so many layers of humor Iâ€™m sure there is tons of stuff Iâ€™ve havenâ€™t caught the tenth time through an episode.</li><li><strong>Arrested Development</strong><br>But Chris! Arrested Development isnâ€™t a cartoon! This is my blog, I do what I want. Arrested Development is the funniest show ever.</li><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=article-end>ðŸ¤˜</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibmKe2tK%2FOsqCeql6jsrV7kWlnb2dgZnxxgo5qZ2aepaO7qrHSrWScmaKpvLC60macr52iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
