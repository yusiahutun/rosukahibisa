Remembering multiple passwords can get annoying, but it’s a necessary sacrifice to make when protecting your company laptop.&nbsp;</p><p>Strong passwords need a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols to be truly secure. Ideally, keep your password long and add more variety to the characters. The complexity makes it more difficult for hackers to access your password-protected files.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4.
