Let's find out.</p><h2 id=what-you-need-to-create-and-play-a-rom-hack>What You Need to Create and Play a ROM Hack</h2><p>Because of the nature of ROM Hacking, there are specific things you will need to ensure you have before creating and playing a ROM Hacked game. To create and play a ROM Hack you must first ensure you have these key things:</p><ul><li>A legal ROM. If you haven't copied your ROM from a game you own it would be illegal to play or use that ROM to create a ROM Hack.</li><li>You'll also need a UPS or IPS Patch File to apply to your legal ROM.</li><li>Based on the type of Patch File, you'll need specific software to apply Patch Files to your ROM.</li><li>To play your ROM-Hacked game, you'll need an emulator that is compatible with the platform your ROM is for.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pokemon-emerald-rogue.jpg><p>As well as having the key requirements for playing and creating ROM Hacks, you may also want to look through <a href=#>the pros and cons of emulation</a> before deciding to continue. After all, while emulation is safe and legal if you own the game your ROM originated from, there are still potential complications.</p><p>But, if you're all set to start creating your own ROM Hack, you may need to know more about the Patch Files required and the software you need to apply the patch.</p><h2 id=what-are-patch-files>What Are Patch Files?</h2><p>Patch Files are created to patch over a base ROM and create a new experience. Unfortunately, Patch Files also come in numerous forms, commonly IPS and UPS. Each type of Patch File requires certain software to patch your base ROM with:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li>For any type of Patch File, you can download UniPatcher through the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Google Play Store</a> to use an Android device to apply your Patch File.</li><li>For specific UPS Patch Files, you can download NUPS Patcher from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ROMhacking</a> to use your PC to apply your Patch File.</li><li>For specific IPS Patch Files, you can download LunarIPS from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ROMhacking</a> to apply patches through your PC.</li></ul><p>Applying Patch Files isn't too dissimilar to using third-party software when <a href=#>randomizing Pokémon games</a> and works best with classic Nintendo platforms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pokemon.jpg><p>For instance, if you have a legal ROM for Pokémon Emerald, and a UPS Patch File to turn the game into Pokémon Emerald Rogue, you will need to ensure you use software that supports UPS patching like NUPS Patcher or UniPatcher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But you will still need to ensure you find your Patch Files from official sources. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokecommunity</a>, for instance, allows ROM Hack creators to directly post Patch Files for games like Pokémon Emerald Rogue.</p><h2 id=how-to-patch-a-rom-and-start-playing-rom-hacks>How to Patch a ROM and Start Playing ROM Hacks</h2><p>With a legal ROM, an associated Patch File, and software to apply the patch, you're ready to create your ROM Hack. Regardless of the type of Patch File you have or what device you are looking to patch your ROM through, the process for applying a ROM patch is the same.</p><p>But if you use UniPatcher for Android, you can apply any type of Patch File. To universally patch your ROM, open UniPatcher, and follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Ensure the ROM and Patch File are stored on the device you are using UniPatcher with.</li><li>Select <strong>Patch file</strong> and find the Patch File you want to apply to a ROM in the files for your device.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/patch-file.jpg><ul><li>With the Patch File added into UniPatcher, select <strong>ROM file</strong> and similarly choose the base ROM you wish to turn into a ROM Hack.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot_2023-05-29-21-41-44-80_c7900a162987cee658b524bb5b60b760.jpg><ul><li>From here, choose <strong>Output file</strong> and select a suitable destination to save your ROM Hack.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/rom-file-and-output.jpg><ul><li>Finally, select the download icon at the bottom-right of your screen to patch your ROM and save the ROM Hack.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regardless of your chosen patching software, patching a ROM remains the same: choose a Patch File, select the associated base ROM, and export your ROM Hack.</p><p>With your ROM Hack created you need to load the correct emulation software to play your game.
