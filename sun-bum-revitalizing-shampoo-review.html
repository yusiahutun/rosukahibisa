Here's what you need to know: You don't need to spend a fortune for beautiful hair. I've used shampoos that cost upwards of $100 that weren't that great, meanwhile my latest favorite option is <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">an affordable $10 bottle</a> that's made me feel like I belong in a haircare commercial.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On a recent scouting expedition at CVS, I noticed that Sun Bum, known best for its smells-like-summer suncare collection, expanded its lineup to include skincare and haircare. And, because I am totally here for smelling like coconuts on the beach all year long, I decided to try the brand's <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Revitalizing Shampoo</a> and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Conditioner</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not only do the shampoo and conditioner have an intoxicating scent, but their gluten-, silicone-, and paraben-free formulas have worked wonders on my parched and over-chlorinated summer hair. The products have made my strands look so good that I've reached for the bottles wash after wash — and even my stylist, Ian Hoffner at Mane Techniques in Wayne, PA, approves.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $10; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$10; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few days after I started using the shampoo and conditioner duo I went in for a balayage treatment. Like most stylists, he asked about the products I was currently using. I sheepishly told him, thinking he would give me a hard time for using a $10 drugstore shampoo. I was pleasantly surprised that Hoffner, a self-proclaimed ingredient reader, endorsed my choice. "For the price point, it packs a punch full of excellent ingredients for your hair," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He elaborated on a few of the ingredients in the fruity formula that make the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Sun Bum Revitalizing Shampoo</a> a favorite on Amazon with thousands of five-star reviews. Coconut oil "helps to deliver intense hydration and tame frizz," Hoffner tells InStyle. Several banana ingredients not only infuse the shampoo with a lovely scent, but are also responsible for making hair appear silkier and shinier, and can also add moisture to a dry scalp. Other key ingredients include quinoa protein, which "strengthens hair growth and protects your hair from environmental pollution," and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>sunflower seed oil</a>, which has "intense nourishing properties that aid in manageability of the hair and promotes a healthier scalp and hair growth," Hoffner says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After a week of using the duo along with some of the brand's other products, including the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Coconut Argan Oil</a> and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Protecting Anti-Frizz Oil Mist</a>, I received some unsolicited compliments about my hair from friends. "Whatever you use, it is working," one of them told me, commenting on how silky, hydrating, and healthy it looked. I have continued lathering up with it and my hair continues to reap nourishing results.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$20; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $15; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Amazon reviewers with various hair types agree that using the Sun Bum shampoo and conditioner together leaves hair "soft and non-greasy" and smelling like "summer all year round."
