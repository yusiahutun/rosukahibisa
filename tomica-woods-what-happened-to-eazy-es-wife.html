What happened to her, and where is she now?</strong></p><p>Being married to a prominent rapper like Eazy-E will bring much media attention, even if the marriage lasts only 12 days. Tomica Woods has continued to use that media attention to preserve her husband’s legacy and run his record label, ensuring Eazy-E’s name never vanishes from the history books.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Tomica_Woods_Wright></span>Who Is Tomica Woods Wright?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tomica Woods Wright is a record producer, businesswoman, and entrepreneur. She is famously known as the late legendary hip-hop rapper Eazy-E’s wife in the entertainment industry. She is most commonly referred to as Tomica Woods, but her legal name, thanks to her marriage to the rapper, is Tomica Woods Wright, as she adopted his surname after their marriage.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tomica.jpg><p>Woods was born in Los Angeles, California, on December 7, 1969. Her parents’ names are unknown to the public, but they reportedly divorced shortly after she was born. Woods spent most of her childhood divided between her mother, father, and some foster homes.&nbsp;</p><p>It is unclear if she has siblings, as their details are also unknown.&nbsp;However, Woods had a solid educational background. She attended San Fernando Valley High School and then joined Santa Monica College, where she graduated after two years.</p><p>A few years later, the celebrity wife enrolled in West Los Angeles College, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in media studies and management in 1992.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tomica_Woods_and_Eazy-Es_Relationship></span>Tomica Woods and Eazy-E’s Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Eazy-E</a> and Tomica Woods met at a Los Angeles nightclub in 1991. The two quickly hit it off and began dating a few months later. They dated for about four years before deciding to tie the knot in 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>Their wedding took place at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on March 14, 1995, due to the declining health of the rapper. He had been diagnosed with AIDS and would not improve due to the limited technology and available treatment methods.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/both.jpg><p>Sadly, Eazy E’s health worsened, and he died on March 26, 1995, just 12 days after his marriage to Woods. He died due to AIDS-induced pneumonia at 31. This was only a few days after he had disclosed to the world that he was living with AIDS at a Hollywood conference on March 17, 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>Woods and the late rapper had two biological children, Dominick Wright and Daijah. Eazy-E also had nine other children from his other relationships, making Woods a stepmother to all nine. The other children are Eric Darnell, Erin Bria, Henree Cherron, Derreck, Erica, Marquise, Raven, Elijah, and David.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tomica_Woods_Career></span>Tomica Woods’ Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The celebrity wife is a professional record producer, businesswoman, and entrepreneur.

However, Eazy-E’s record label was not the beginning of Woods’ career in the entertainment industry.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/eazye-745x1024.jpg><p>She started her career by serving as the secretary to Tabu Records’ founder, Clarence Avant. A few years later, she moved with Avant to his new label, Motown Records, in 1993. She eventually left the title and was working with Eazy-E’s label before his passing.</p><p>When he died, she inherited his record label and became its CEO.&nbsp;The record label, founded by Eazy-E and Jerry Heller in Compton, California, in 1986, still exists.&nbsp;</p><p>Woods ensured that all the company’s dealings were done appropriately and cemented the label’s position in the hip-hop and rap industry as one of the top labels ever. She has worked with hip-hop legends such as <a href=#>Dr. Dre</a> and DK Yella.&nbsp;</p><p>Ruthless Records now has a vast roster of successful artists thanks to Woods’ hard work and a massive distribution deal she signed with Epic/Sony Records.&nbsp;While doing all these, Woods must keep her late husband’s legacy afloat.</p><p>She is the executive producer of the documentary films that focus on the legendary rapper’s life titled “Eazy-E: The Impact of a Legend,” “Bone Thugs-N-Harmony: Greatest Video Hits” and “Straight Outta Compton.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Tomica_Woods_Still_Alive></span>Is Tomica Woods Still Alive?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Tomica Woods is still very much alive.
