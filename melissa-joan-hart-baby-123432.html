“We got a girl dog last year for Christmas. My middle son was awesome last year so he got a puppy, and we got a female so that helped a little.

During an exclusive interview with Closer Weekly, the Melissa & Joey alum opened up about the possibility of expanding her family.</p><p>“We got a girl dog last year for Christmas. My middle son was awesome last year so he got a puppy, and we got a female so that helped a little. She’s crazy though, so that didn’t really help — but I always wanted a fourth. My husband kind of convinced me that, we want to travel with the boys and stuff, and if we were to have another one — the older one is getting a lot older and if we had another child, by the time we blink and that one’s able to travel, the older one is out. I think we’re at capacity, as my husband likes to say,” she shared.</p><p>“I would love to have a fourth, though. I think a girl would throw me off big time — having to do hair, glitter everywhere — I don’t think I could handle it. I’m not great at dressing myself because I always worked on sets where people made my food, dressed me, did my hair and makeup, so I never learned how to do hair. I never really learned how to dress appropriately. I feel like those are things that take a lot of time with girls. It’s hard enough for me to get my kids to brush my teeth to get in the car for school, and they’re already 15 minutes late for school every day! I think it would throw the whole dynamic off in the family, though it would soften things up a bit, which would be good — but if I’m going to have a fourth baby, it’s probably not going to be a girl. Let’s be honest, it’s going to be a boy, which is fine, just a lot of energy.”</p><p>Melissa and the Course of Nature band mate tied the knot in 2003 and are parents to three beautiful boys — 11-year-old Mason Walter, nine-year-old Braydon Hart, and five-year-old Tucker McFadden. Closer had the pleasure of speaking with Melissa as she teamed up with Jif Peanut Butter to launch their <a href=#>Imagine If, With Jif</a> contest — which according to a press release, was designed to “help fuel and nourish the potential of the next generation. Together with a panel of contest judges, including actress and mom Melissa Joan Hart, Jif will award $50,000 to support three families’ entrepreneurial and creative ideas.”</p><p><b>Check out the gallery to see stars who’ve given birth over age 40!</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mnKWho6iubrbOmqVmoJGnwW6uwJuwZmliaIF0fo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
