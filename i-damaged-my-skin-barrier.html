It could be that your skin barrier is damaged.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to dermatologist Claire Y. Chang, M.D., when your skin barrier is compromised — as is the case when you experience an allergic reaction or when you're dealing with a skin condition (e.g. atopic dermatitis aka&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eczema</a>) — loss of moisture can occur. The result is dry skin that is often accompanied by irritation and inflammation. While this can be uncomfortable, fortunately, it can be treated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To find out how, we tapped Dr. Chang and dermatologists Stacy Chimento, M.D. and Patricia Wexler, M.D. for their best tips and advice.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-the-skin-barrier></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is the Skin Barrier?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Chimento, the skin barrier is the outermost layer of the skin that functions to keep all of the good things in and the bad things out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Your skin barrier is what keeps you alive by keeping all sorts of harmful environmental toxins and pathogens from penetrating your body," Dr. Chimento explained. "Your skin barrier also keeps the water inside your body that would otherwise escape and evaporate, leaving you completely dehydrated."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The skin barrier also holds high levels of ceramides that protect the immunologic and homeostasis health of the skin, added Dr. Wexler, a dermatological surgeon.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-signs-of-a-damaged-skin-barrier></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Signs of a Damaged Skin Barrier</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to dry, inflamed skin, Dr. Chimento said a sign of a damaged skin barrier is when you experience symptoms like scaly skin, acne, itchiness, discoloration, or bacterial or fungal infections.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another cause of barrier impairment? External aggressors. For example, dry weather, allergens, environmental pollution, over-exfoliation, and using harsh soaps or detergents can all damage the skin barrier, noted Dr. Chang, who recommended avoiding excess sun exposure, which disrupts your skin barrier and causes premature skin aging.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prevent-and-repair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prevent and Repair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The key to repairing your skin barrier is keeping it simple and hyper-focusing on moisturizing. Fortunately, this is a relatively quick and easy fix that can be done from the comfort of your own home. Here are five expert-approved ways to fix and restore a damaged skin barrier:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Simplify Your Skincare Routine</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Skincare routines with 10 steps may sound like they're addressing every type of skincare concern. However, for some, they may actually be contributing to skin issues. Using too many actives and combining ingredients that shouldn't be mixed together can result in a damaged skin barrier, according to Dr. Chimento. Simplify your skincare routine by limiting the number of products you use. Your skin — and wallet — will thank you.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Eliminate Potential Irritants</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Chang suggested external aggressors, such as excess sun exposure, dry weather, allergens, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>environmental pollution</a>, can cause barrier impairment — but that's not all. The CeraVe brand partner added that harsh soaps, scrubs, excess exfoliation, and long, hot baths can also irritate the skin barrier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Protecting yourself against environmental aggressors by using a daily broad-spectrum sunscreen and products with free-radical-fighting antioxidants, like those found in&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Dr. Barbara Sturm Anti-Pollution Drops</a>&nbsp;($60), will promote a healthy skin barrier.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Swap in Hydrating Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Chimento said to look for skincare ingredients such as ceramides, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, or glycerin in your product formulas to improve dryness and strengthen your skin barrier.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It is crucial to moisturize your skin daily to repair the skin barrier," emphasized Dr. Chang.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Chang also recommended using&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>humidifiers</a>&nbsp;during the winter to keep the air and your skin moisturized.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Treat Inflammation</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your damaged skin barrier is the result of an allergic reaction — perhaps to a new skincare product — you may experience stinging, burning, blotchiness, and more breakouts. Consider swapping out most of your go-to serums, oils, and cleansers for mild (read: less likely to irritate and with little actives) formulas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Inflammation is another symptom of a compromised barrier. To find relief, look for anti-inflammatory ingredients, such as&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>calendula</a>, niacinamide, witch hazel, and ceramides. The skin barrier holds high levels of ceramides that protect the immunologic and homeostasis health of the skin, Dr. Wexler told us. Using products with ceramides will help to reinforce its strength. For a DIY approach, consider making a face mask with common household ingredients with anti-inflammatory properties like aloe, cucumber, and colloidal oatmeal.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Follow a Dermatologist-Recommended Skincare Routine</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've revised your skincare routine but are still unsure about which products to use, ask a dermatologist.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Wexler recommended a regimen that uses gentle&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>micellar water</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Eucerin Eczema Relief Cream</a>&nbsp;($12),&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Elta MD Clear SPF Broad Spectrum 46</a>&nbsp;($41), and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>SkinMedica HA5 Rejuvenating Hydrator</a>&nbsp;($147).
