Interacting with and meeting each of you is a great privilege. Your kindness and generosity inspire me, and I wish I could personally thank you for every gift I receive,”&nbsp;<a href=#>The Masked Singer</a>&nbsp;performer wrote in an Instagram post.</p><p>In the pic, the 61-year-old can be seen smiling while standing beside a stunning peacock sculpture. “Today I want to share a picture of a gift I recently received along with a thoughtful letter from two sisters,” Donny continued, adding a short snippet of the note into the caption of the heartwarming post. “Here are a few lines of that letter: A few weeks ago Julia and I went on a road trip and discovered an old refurbished barn which sold various wares. We immediately saw this peacock and thought of you Donny!”</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href=#>Donny was a contestant on the hit Fox TV show The Masked Singer</a>. Although the former teen idol — who hid his identity behind the peacock character’s ensemble on the singing competition — came up short to <strong>T-Pain</strong>, Donny inspired a lot of people.</p><p>“Our family has so enjoyed watching you on @maskedsingerfox and knew in our hearts you would love this,” the letter from the two ladies continued. “Thank you so much for all you have shared with the world. We hope this peacock will help bring back those wonderful times you had as the Masked #Peacock.” ⁣</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/donny-osmond-the-masked-singer-peacock.png><p>At the end of his post, Donny thanked ⁣his fans Julia and Hazelann for the “thoughtful gift,” adding that the peacock sculpture is going to be a “perfect touch to my dressing room at @flamingovegas.” So cool!</p><p>Following the season finale of the singing show, the “Go Away Little Girl” crooner opened up about being apart of the amazing experience. “I had the time of my life here. It’s the best thing of my life,” Donny gushed at the time. “It’s better than being Donny Osmond!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dpqemqWK8tLnOp5tmqpWrsqK40maroZ1dpbKir86comark6q5scDUq5xmal2brq%2B%2FjKCgn6yVmXqptcxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
