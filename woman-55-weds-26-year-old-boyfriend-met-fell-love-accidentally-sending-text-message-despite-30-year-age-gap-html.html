She had been divorced for six years and had come to terms with the idea that she wouldn't find love again, but Henry managed to sweep her off her feet with romantic gestures.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Their romance continued to move at a fast pace, and within two months, Henry moved out of his parents house and into Kasey's apartment.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'My parents were accepting from the start. We were happy, healthy, and they've always known me to be my own person even if it is in a nontraditional way,' Henry explained to Daily Mail Online. 'I'm sure my parents recognize a vast age difference between us, but I don't think I ever told them how old she is.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Kacey's parents were supportive, too - as were her two stepdaughters, one of whom is the same age as Henry, while the other is four years older than him.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In the beginning, they occasionally worried that people would think that Henry was Kasey's son, but over time they've learned to just roll with it.</span></p><img id=i-25193c98c9cf779e src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/09/30/16/2CEFB43900000578-3254928-image-a-13_1443625581483.jpg height=476 width=634 alt="On the same wavelength: Henry told Kacey he loved her after only a few weeks, but Kacey didn't think the gesture was 'over-the-top'; the two moved in together after just two months" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>On the same wavelength: Henry told Kacey he loved her after only a few weeks, but Kacey didn't think the gesture was 'over-the-top'; the two moved in together after just two months</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Both with people we know, and strangers, sometimes think I'm her son,' Henry explained.

Kasey said, adding that they'd invited 30 guests and she'd found her 'perfect' hippie dress at the mall.
