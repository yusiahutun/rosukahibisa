The four episodes feature many flashbacks to the fateful night in question – bringing up many gaps in Anya's story – leaving many to wonder whether Anya really is responsible for the murder.</p><h2>What happens at the end of Netflix's The Perfect Mother?</h2><p id=ed47XZS0uYiE data-wc=70>Those who reached the end will know that Anya was much more involved in Damien's death than she first let on. Firstly, Anya had moved to Paris from Germany to get away from her previous life which saw her abused in a previous relationship. Secondly, she was not attending an in-person college, but instead working to help victims of abuse, and using her college dormitory to house those in need.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/52f289fd57b8-helene-perfect-mother-z.jpg><p id=eTCtp-kf3bq3 data-wc=8><strong>The four-part series is proving popular with viewers</strong></p><p id=evZB0EL1GQnE data-wc=72>Due to her traumatic past, and the fellow victims she came across through her work at a women's shelter, Anya becomes deeply and emotionally involved in the cases. One crucial moment which is revealed is when Anya and a friend, Julie, decided to get revenge on a professor who is a predator. The friend deliberately drugs herself and Anya plans to catch the perpetrator in his tracks while the two are alone.</p><p id=eCSZYF02Yoxe data-wc=46>After coming to learn of Damien, who is a known attacker, Anya plans to exact revenge on him using the same method. However, Anya finds herself taking part in the operation alone and at the hands of Damien's drug-fuelled rage, ends up being attacked by him.</p><p id=eCqD0Vc0fFtb data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Stranger Things season four: questions we have for volume two</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2dab7af4c04e-eden-netflix-z.jpg><p id=eX5fjd0p81_T data-wc=4><strong>Eden Decourant plays Anya</strong></p><p id=eDtbFmvidp4u data-wc=59>Anya had been in what she considered a loving relationship with someone she met at one of the organisations called Kamal and it is he who Anya calls over to the apartment to save her. At this point, Kamal and Damien get in a fight and, in an act of self-defense, Anya picks up a knife and stabs Damien.</p><p id=eyjQ6FpufJMv data-wc=70>Before the truth comes out, Anya discovers, through her mother's investigation, that Kamal is in fact married with a child. Feeling betrayed, Anya tells the authorities that Kamal was involved in Damien's death – after previously not incriminating him – but this leads to him jumping off a bridge and taking his own life. The murder is then hung on him – leaving Anya to get away with stabbing Damien.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1u7AbJ89sNh data-wc=68>As well as Anya, the show focuses on Helene and her striving to be the perfect mother, but being so worried about how she's perceived that she neglects what's really going on in her children's lives. It ends with her feeling torn about whether to follow her family – Anya and her new husband, Matthias – or her old flame, Vincent, with whom she had rekindled a spark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a3e72727fbff-julie-gayet-z.jpg><p id=e5M4EKiKH2V9 data-wc=6><strong>Julia Gayet plays her mother, Helene</strong></p><h2>What are fans making of Netflix's The Perfect Mother?</h2><p id=ejNqqXWbS56C data-wc=56>Given the series is in the top ten trending shows on Netflix, it's no wonder that fans have been watching it in their droves, with many taking to Twitter to give their verdict.
