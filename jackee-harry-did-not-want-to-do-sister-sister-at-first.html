"But my sister eventually convinced me to take the part and I’m glad I did because it helped me realize how fulfilling it is to mentor younger women."</p><p>"Showing other people how to develop their skills & talents, helping them gain confidence, self-worth, self-awareness, love for others – it feeds my soul in a way that not even acting does," she continued. "Imagine my happiness when I see the wonderful women & mothers Tia & Tamera have become."</p><p>She was also thrilled to see how much the character resonated with viewers and, only later, realized just "how important it was to have a Black mom like her on TV."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fa6af77e-2942-4769-9136-e3507670892a data-container-ref=toofab:article:684f4508-bf74-48eb-8ad6-f7f8e3e560c0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8c/5by4/2020/08/14/8ca5af6d12944f7cb9ba7080b3843bac_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Everett Collection</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Iconic Roles That Were Almost Played By Radically Different Actors</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"It goes to show that when somebody connects with you and allows you to teach them (in person or even through the television screen), what they're really giving you is the opportunity to show them that they're not alone," she continued. "To all the moms out there who are doing your best to raise your kids and hustling so hard to achieve your dreams, I see you. I love you.
