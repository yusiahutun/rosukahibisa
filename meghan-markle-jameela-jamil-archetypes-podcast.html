In the latest episode of Meghan's Spotify podcast, Archetypes, the duo teams up to talk about the criticism Jamil occasionally faces for speaking out on activist causes, from reproductive rights to mental health. The Good Place actress connects that criticism to the barrage of attacks Meghan also faces.
&#34;It's just, it's an unfathomable amount of sh*t that you take, Meghan.

I can't believe it," Jamil says. "And I fought back on your behalf of years before I'd ever met you, because I was so outraged by the twisting of this very normal, very kind, very civilized woman. That demonization just shows how afraid they are of you."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She adds, "I'm so sorry you've had to withstand it. It has highlighted for us the intense and unkindness and, and bigotry and misogyny of our media.

And it was very nice for me to see that you have that in your home."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Later, Jamil expresses her gratitude toward Meghan for supporting her through hard times.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"You have been such a sobering voice of unwavering support to me," the actress says. "And people don't know that you frequently reach out to women who are having a very, very hard time. You reach out to us. You don't do it publicly. You don't come to get any glory, but you privately reach out to us in our most lonely and desperate moments. And we need more of that in the world. And so, I just I appreciate you and thank you for that, because those are some hairy moments and I needed that guidance. So, thanks. Thanks, mate."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
