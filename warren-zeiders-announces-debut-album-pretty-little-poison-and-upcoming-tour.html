The upcoming release, comprised of 14 tracks, four of which were produced by Bart Butler and Ryan Gore and the other ten produced by Ross Copperman, is part road warrior, part old-fashioned grit, and a multitude of genre influences that have catapulted him to one of the country’s most exciting newcomers."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The past two years have seen the newcomer have his first national television appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show; his first national tour, which sold out in 72 hours; his debut performance on the Grand Ole Opry stage; and even his first Top 40 hit on the Billboard charts, all before he began recording his debut album. Maybe that’s why Pretty Little Poison brims with such excitement and self-assurance.</p><p>“A lot of this album is about a girl, and a lot of it is about me,” says Zeiders, who fills the album with honest lyrics about life, love, and lessons learned. “I’m paying tribute to that classic country sound but keeping things modern, too. At the end of the day, I’m just putting my heart on my sleeve and putting myself onstage.”</p><p>Zeiders’ brand of country music is as broad as his shoulders, which still bear the evidence of a longtime sports career. Highlights from the album include:</p><p>“God Only Knows” is a southern rock anthem built for summertime parties and backwoods joyrides, “Painkiller” explores the darkness of outlaw country and “Inside Your Head,” written by Country Music juggernaut <strong>Chris Stapleton</strong>, brings on the steel guitars and classic country.</p><p>For Zeiders, whose viral cover of “Tennessee Whiskey” played such a crucial role in his own rise to success, featuring a Stapleton cut on his debut album feels a whole lot like fate. He also worked with several other songwriters, co-writing songs with <strong>Eric Paslay, Randy Montana, Ryan Beaver, Lee Thomas Miller, Benjy Davis, Austin Taylor Smith, Jarred Keim</strong>, and others.</p><p>“Faith, family, and athletics were the three pillars of my life long before I started playing music,” he says. “I haven’t forgotten that. I’m always learning new things — if you stop doing that, you stop growing — but I’m staying true to who I am, too. This album is my story. It’s who I am. It’s who I’ve always been. I may not be playing lacrosse anymore, but I haven’t lost the discipline or focus that I learned as an athlete. I still put in the work. I still push myself. I go onstage and treat it like it’s a game day.”</p><p>Zeiders’ Pretty Little Poison Tour “game days” are selling out across the country, and he just performed to a sold-out Ohio Stadium alongside <strong>George Strait, Chris Stapleton</strong> and <strong>Little Big Town.</strong></p><p><strong><span>Pretty Little Poison Tracklist:</span></strong><br>1. “Pretty Little Poison” (Warren Zeiders,
