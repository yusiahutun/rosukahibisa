A third family member, Donna Farrugia, was found guilty of knowingly aiding and abetting the exports, and suspended for a year and a half.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Farrugias had bought the dogs from greyhound racetracks across the state, often when they were no longer wanted by their owners.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They were then exported to China with the approval of the Australian agricultural department, generating the Farrugias a profit of about US$300 per dog.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/11/23/ba6611f2-d021-11e7-986f-48a2e310a482_1320x770_155604.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The animals faced horrendous conditions abroad. At the Macau Canidrome, dogs are routinely destroyed if they underperform or fail to make a profit.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">We know that dogs are sent to the USA and then re-exported to China, where there are hardly any laws protecting animals from abuseMehreen Faruqi, NSW Greens MP</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the Shanghai zoo, they are kept in hot and dark concrete cells and made to participate in cruel spectacles for visitors. That includes a 100m race with a cheetah for the title of “fastest in animal kingdom”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Greyhound Racing NSW has attempted to stop exports to places of cruelty by requiring owners to obtain a greyhound passport from Greyhounds Australasia. Passports are only issued to certain countries. China is not one of them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The passport regime, in the case of the Farrugias, failed. There is no federal law preventing the export of greyhounds to places of cruelty.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Farrugias had obtained permits through the federal agriculture department and complied with its requirements.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The family members said they were unaware of the NSW requirement for a passport and were not told of any such requirement by the department.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Greyhound Racing NSW on Thursday announced it was implementing new rules to attempt to prevent exports to places of cruelty.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It will make it an offence for someone to transfer greyhounds when they “either know or ought to know that the greyhound will likely be exported without a greyhound passport”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The change effectively places responsibility on the original owner of the greyhound not to give their dog to an exporter, if they think it will be sent somewhere without the proper authorisation.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">As long as there is money being made ... they will find a way of doing it regardless of these rulesMehreen Faruqi, NSW Greens MP</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a statement announcing the change, Greyhound Racing NSW noted the change would not stop greyhounds being exported to places with poor welfare records, due to the lack of any federal restrictions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The lack of a greyhound passport does not preclude a greyhound from being exported from Australia and the federal regulatory scheme does not take account of the animal welfare standards of the destination country,” the agency said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The NSW Greens MP Mehreen Faruqi welcomed the rule change but said it would do little to stop the practice.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We know that dogs are sent to the USA and then re-exported to China, where there are hardly any laws protecting animals from abuse,” Faruqi said. “As long as there is money being made of greyhound exports to China and Macau, they will find a way of doing it regardless of these rules.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Faruqi said the passports scheme had failed. She called on the federal government to “show some leadership” and cease the issuing of export permits for racing greyhounds.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Limits on greyhound trade after scandal</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miYrKGRZK62v9OrmKWZo56ucK3RraCcpJVkf3J%2BkGttcWeemsRuuMCwZKmqlauyr8DSZpiuq6Snrq21wKdkoKqVrrWwwc2dqmaalZ67qHnTmqKepl2Ytaq6wGaYn6yVpw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
