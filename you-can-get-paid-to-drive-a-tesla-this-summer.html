  Yes, you can get paid to drive around a Tesla for the company. While it may sound like a dream job to some, remember that this is only a 2-3 month seasonal gig, and you'll be sitting in an EV all day, but at least it sounds interesting."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While it may sound like a dream job to some, remember that this is only a 2-3 month seasonal gig, and you'll be sitting in an EV all day, but at least it sounds interesting.</p><p>So what does the job entail? It's difficult to say, but you'll drive around in specific areas or scenarios while the vehicle gathers data to improve its camera and radar systems, <a href=#>self-driving capabilities</a>, and auto-pilot. The job listings specifically mention "capturing high-quality data that will contribute to the improvement of vehicle&nbsp;performance."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tesla Wants Its Unlimited Free Supercharging Back</a></span></p><p>There are currently 18 <a href=#>job listings available</a> in the United States, with four being the late-night shift, paying anywhere from $17-$43 per hour (plus benefits) to drive a fancy new electric vehicle. The job description states:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We are looking for a highly motivated self-starter to join our vehicle data collection team. The Vehicle Operator role is responsible for capturing high-quality data that will contribute to the improvement of our vehicles performance. This role requires a high level of flexibility, attention to detail, and ability to work in a fast-paced dynamic environment. Day/night shift positions available."</p><p>Further down, it explains that anyone hired as a Seasonal Vehicle operator will operate the vehicle in designated areas for data collection. It's worth mentioning that it doesn't use the word "drive" as there's a chance some of this will be autonomous self-driving tests. You'll also be responsible for start/stopping all in-vehicle recording systems, providing feedback, and writing a daily driving report in Microsoft Word.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a71e069b.jpg> <a href=#>Tesla</a><p>It should go without saying, but you'll need a clean driving record, at least four years of driving experience, and several other menial requirements to be eligible for the roles.</p><p>So, if you live in one of several cities throughout Utah,&nbsp;Illinois, Texas, Washington, Colorado, California, Florida, and others, you could get a temporary summer job driving a Tesla.</p><p>With millions of Tesla vehicles on the road, the company has a huge advantage over other legacy automakers when gathering real-world data. In fact, that's something Tesla has highlighted while <a href=#>talking about the future</a> and autonomous vehicles. That said, it looks like the company wants or needs more and is willing to hire seasonal full-time employees to drive around in select cities.</p><p>via <a href=#>Electrek</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhobnBjan5wxc6uZJyZnmK0psCMqZiinF2pvG6w0aKtnmWRYsGmv8uaZK2gmah6tMHMppyrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
