The singer invited his mom out to share the spotlight during his performance of &#34;Everything's Gonna Be Alright,&#34; a No. 1 hit from his 2018 No Zip Code album. In the studio version of the song, Chesney's duet partner is David Lee Murphy, but the song took on a sweet new meaning as a mother-son duet."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In the studio version of the song, Chesney's duet partner is <a href=#>David Lee Murphy</a>, but the song took on a sweet new meaning as a mother-son duet.</p><p>Chesney wrapped his arm around his mom as they sang together, holding a microphone up to her as she sang along, beaming with pride and joy.</p><p>The crowd that night, at Denver's Empower Field at Mile High, boasted more than 60,000 fans, but Karen didn't seem&nbsp;nervous at all as she sang and danced alongside her superstar son.</p><p>"Give mom a big round [of applause,]" Chesney said as Karen left the stage at the end of the song, and the fans happily obliged.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Pop Culture</a>, Chesney's mom gave birth to him at 19 and got divorced when he was still very young. She instilled in him the importance of learning to be happy on his own terms, instead of seeking validation from a relationship.</p><p>"She said, 'Kenny, I just want you to know I'd rather be miserable alone than miserable with somebody else.' That makes a lot of sense to me," the singer previously recounted.</p><p><a href=#>Country Now</a> also reports that the singer's mother taught him how to handle life's curveballs with ease. "She’s been through a lot in her life. And she’s handled it. And she’s come it, I believe, with a lot of grace and a lot of style. And I’ve learned a lot from that," he reflected.</p><p>The pair remain close to this day. Backstage at Chesney's Denver show,&nbsp;Mom even joined the band's "pre-show dance ritual," stealing the show as Chesney hopped in to bust out a few moves of his own.</p><p>"What a blast and what joy!" the singer noted in the caption of his post.</p><p>Chesney's show in Denver was filled with high points, but it was also <a href=#>touched by tragedy</a>: At the end of the night, a concertgoer fell to her death from the rail of an escalator. The singer subsequently issued a statement saying he was "devastated" by the incident.</p><p>"Life is precious. Sharing music brings us together and that love we share makes us so much more," his statement read in part. "For the lady who came to share that love, there are no words. For her friends' and family's loss, I grieve with them and for them."</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Kenny Chesney's Spectacular $14 Million Tennessee Estate</h2><p>Kenny Chesney has listed his 4-bedroom, 9-bathroom, 12,599-square-foot hilltop estate in Tennessee for just under $14 million, and pictures show an opulent Mediterranean villa that is lavish even by the standards of other celebrity mansions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJ2eo8Zur8eeqqedqWK6sLmMnq2eqqmptaq6xqxkoKeeo65ursRmmKWqmZy1tXnDrpytZZSau7ex0Wg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
