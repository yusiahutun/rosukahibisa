Just days before the singer <a href=# rel=dofollow>announced she’s pregnant with her second baby</a>, Carrie told <a href=# rel=dofollow>Redbook</a> that she likely won’t be able to have a lot more kids because she’s already 35 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m 35, so we may have missed our chance to have a big family. We always talk about adoption and doing it when our child or children are a little older,” she told the magazine. Shortly after her quotes hit the press, several people expressed their frustration over Carrie’s comments online.&nbsp;</p><p>“Seriously Miss Underwood, I was 44 and my wife 42 when child number seven was born. It depends on your health and your desire only,” <a href=# rel=dofollow>one person wrote</a> on Twitter with another similarly adding, “Carrie, you can still have babies at 35… women are having babies later in life than your mother Carol’s generation. They try to establish their careers where mom’s generation a lot of times were happy as housewives. Nowadays, you need two [salaries] to make a ‘go of it’ with children.”</p><p>However, a few people did agree with Carrie’s statement. “It is a medical FACT that when a woman reaches 40 she is in the HIGH risk for having a child, I have a daughter-in-law that has just gone through that with her doctor and he has said that with each year it can get worse,” one person wrote on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>Carrie and her husband, Mike, 38, <a href=# rel=dofollow>tied the knot in July 2010</a> and welcomed their only child, <a href=# rel=dofollow>son Isaiah Fisher</a><a href=# rel=dofollow>,</a> 3, in February 2015. On Wednesday, Aug. 8, the <a href=# rel=dofollow>American Idol winner</a> announced via Instagram that she is pregnant with her second baby. “Mike and Isaiah and I are absolutely over the moon and excited to be adding another little fish to our pond. This has just been a dream come true with [the] album and with baby news and all that stuff. We’re just so excited,” she said in a <a href=# rel=dofollow>cute video message to her fans. </a>&nbsp;</p><p>In past years, Carrie has spoken openly about her hopes to expand her family with Mike. When asked in a <a href=# rel=dofollow>previous interview</a> if she wanted to have more kids, she enthusiastically replied, “Oh, definitely! I’m not sure when because we’re both kind of busy these days. But yeah, definitely.” She cutely added, “I’m like, ‘[Isaiah is] so good — I could do a few more of those!'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cmKuqmZp6trrDnqmwp5%2BZeqOtwaKcrGWbnrG0eZBpZ3FvYmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
