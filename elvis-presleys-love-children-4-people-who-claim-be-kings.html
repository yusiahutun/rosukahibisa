In fact, her mum, Lucy De Barbin, even wrote a book about it, Are You Lonesome Tonight: The Untold Story of Elvis Presley’s One True Love and the Child He Never Knew, co-authored with former Miami News reporter Dary Matera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/08/5c6e31a0-bd76-492d-9471-8201a12d40db_de019856.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Matera said he “had doubts all the way along”, but after meeting the mother-daughter duo, he couldn’t deny Desirée’s striking resemblance to The King. “Every word, no matter what she [De Barbin] said, I was able to verify with someone,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/08/a3210c15-691f-42c6-ab7c-a895b4e50971_80f54e88.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">De Barbin chronicles how she met Elvis Presley in 1953 when she was 16, while the future star was 18 and just starting out in music. She says that they continued to see each other for another 24 years and she was planning to tell him about Desirée, but he died before she had the chance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/08/7d49b9b8-3ca5-4e18-893a-d22b29ed4fa0_80f54e88.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, a Graceland rep responded bluntly, “The estate of Elvis Presley maintains the belief that this book is ridiculous and incredible and will not dignify the matter by responding with further comments.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Meet Ann-Margret Olsson, Elvis Presley’s not-so-secret girlfriend</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">2.

In 2013, Smith said, “I’ve known that Elvis is my daddy since I was 27 years old,” and even goes so far as to say that Presley set up a trust fund for him and set up connections so that he could work with stars like Kenny Rogers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although many have dismissed it as a hoax, Smith did eventually show a PDF of a birth certificate stating his birth parents as Elvis A.

Apparently, after her mum said yes, Deborah went to court in 1989 to declare herself the legal heir of the Jailhouse Rock star.</p>“I know he’s my daddy, but <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Colonel Tom Parker</span></a> was never going to let my parents be together; he wanted Elvis to marry Priscilla and she is like the pit bull of the estate, you know what I mean?” she said.Confident she was missing out on millions by being denied her rightful place among the family, she added: “Did you know that the company that bought Elvis Presley Enterprises also owns American Idol?

Born Philip Stanic to Angelique Delores Pettyjohn, the singer claims he was adopted by a circus family, and wrote on his website: “He [Elvis Presley Jr] is the son of the late Elvis Presley born out-of-wedlock, unbeknown to Elvis, on December 24, 1961, in Gary, Indiana the result of a liaison between Elvis Presley and Angelique Delores Pettyjohn, a young actress who was an extra in the film Blue Hawaii.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There’s little to nothing to back up his allegation – let alone a DNA test.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/08/f570b35c-970f-4cf2-b935-53981cb80f13_80f54e88.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cory Cooper, an Elvis Presley historian, says he finds these types of situations “sad”. “These people want to be part of something.
