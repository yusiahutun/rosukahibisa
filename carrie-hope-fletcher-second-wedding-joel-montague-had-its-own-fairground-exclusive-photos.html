"Our first ride was called Sky Dancer, which looks harmless but is like a Ferris wheel with spinning cages that get faster and faster," said Carrie. "It was amazing, but we still felt dizzy half an hour later."</p><h2 dir=ltr>The bride's autumnal wedding dress</h2><p id=etUgtZBxHXk data-wc=60>After wearing a Phase Eight bridal white dress for her Scottish wedding, Carrie chose a more bold, colourful second wedding dress by Rosie Dennington. The autumn-inspired layered lace gown was made of green and orange material and was embroidered with some of the bride and groom's favourite quotes, including the Finding Nemo line: "When I look at you, I’m home."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d27e8ab98567-carrie-hope-fletcher-wedding-dress.jpg><p id=emn8qzywE_m data-wc=36>The bride, who recycled her Gretna Green floral headpiece and dried flowers, explained: "I wanted something that was very autumnal.

Giovanna and Tom's sons Buzz, nine, Buddy, seven, and Max, five, also had special roles as pageboys, firing bubble guns as they walked their aunt up the aisle wearing cute blue, green and red outfits that were chosen as a nod to Carrie's nickname for them – Donald Duck’s mischievous nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Tom Fletcher's emotional wedding performance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4eea750c45d4-tom-fletcher-singing-wedding.jpg><p id=eY71wKPpvkp data-wc=34>While Carrie and Joel took a break from performing on their wedding day, they enlisted the help of Tom Fletcher, who sang Dancing in the Moonlight and I’d Do Anything from the musical Oliver!.</p><p id=exJUpmlPUJA data-wc=40>"Tom was very nervous and there was definitely a wobble in his voice," Carrie recalled.
