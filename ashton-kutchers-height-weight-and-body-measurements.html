So when it comes to Ashton Kutcher’s height, weight, and body measurements, the only answer is: Why not? But before we get into that, let’s look at some fun facts about the star himself.</p><p>He was born&nbsp;Christopher Ashton Kutcher on&nbsp;February 7, 1978, to Diane&nbsp;<i>née</i>&nbsp;Finnegan and&nbsp;Larry M. Kutcher.</p><p>Ashton’s mother was a&nbsp; Procter & Gamble employee, while his father was a factory worker.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Matthew Mcconaughey’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements</a></strong></p><p>So, you may be wondering what his racial cocktail contains; he has some&nbsp;Czech, then a little bit of German and Irish in his blood.</p><p>Ashton has two siblings, an older sister named Tausha and a fraternal twin brother named Michael, over the years his twin has had more than his fair share of medical scares. Today, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is a spokesperson for the advocacy organization&nbsp;Reaching for the Stars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashton-Kutcher-1.jpg><p>He grew up quite poor and often had to donate money to get something extra on top. It was quite intense, he used to work in the cereal department of General Mills, where his father worked as well, sweeping the floors.</p><p>College was the gateway for his journey to stardom, a talent scout discovered him in college, which led to dropping out and pursue modeling. Check some of the old Calvin Klein ads if you want to see some of his early work.</p><p>After moving to Los Angeles in 1998, Ashton landed his first television role on the hit series,&nbsp;That 70’s Show, opposite Mila Kunis, who happens to be Mrs, Kutcher today.</p><p>He’s not only an actor but he is popularly known for being an investor, various restaurants in Los Angeles and New York recognize him as their patron.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Ashton Kutcher’s Height</strong></h2><p>This star is big, not only because he is married to Mila Kunis (honestly, no offense, smaller girls are seriously on the winning side), but also because he is quite big himself. He stands at 6 feet 2.5 inches, which means he is 74.5 inches tall. In metric units, the star is 190 centimeters tall, which is also 1 meter and 90 centimeters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashton-Kutcher-Height.jpg><p>This is just to give you a sense of how high the star is. In this “height-mad” world, people tend to argue about most of the listed celebrity heights. Well, not, in this case, the star looks as big as he says it is (sometimes a little bit bigger).</p><p>Another note: Here is a shortlist of celebrities who are as tall as Ashton Kutcher, or at least claim to be. Donald Trump, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Will Smith, Gerard Butler, and Ryan Reynolds are all the same size as Ashton Kutcher.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Ashton Kutcher’s Weight</strong></h2><p>He is proof that you don’t have to be torn to be hot, and there’s no doubt about that, but along the line, he went the way of actors like Channing Tatum, who started rocking a father’s body shortly after the pressure of being a father set in. But he is doing well because it is not unusual that expectant fathers increase with their wives, the chances are good that they often break down… and you know that a family that breaks down stays together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashton-Kutcher-Weight.jpg><p>He’s a celebrity, so we know deep in our hearts that one day we’ll wake up and find that all those extra pounds have melted away, we don’t have to worry about it and it really shouldn’t be a big deal. The size of the star is given as 80 kilograms, which is probably its body weight before it died.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Charlie Hunnam’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Ashton Kutcher Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>In addition to Ashton Kutcher’s height and weight, here is a summary of his body measurements.</p><p><strong>Height</strong>: 6 feet 2.5 inches</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 80 kilograms</p><p><strong>Chest</strong> <strong>Size</strong>: 44 inches</p><p><strong>Waist Size</strong>: 32 inches</p><p><strong>Arm</strong>/<strong>Biceps</strong>: 15 inches</p><p><strong>Feet</strong>/<strong>Shoe</strong> <strong>Size</strong>:&nbsp;11.5 (US) or 46 (EU) or 11 (UK)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51krrS006ilZqOlqbCpsdGsZKGdmZy1tXnWnqCgoKRirq%2BwjJumnbFdorKiv9SrnKadnqnAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
