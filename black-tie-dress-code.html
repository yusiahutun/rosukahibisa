The black-tie event is not exactly a daily occurrence, and so it is perfectly understandable if you are slightly unsure about how to approach dressing for such an occasion. 
Hold your nerve – it isn't intended to catch you out, rather it's about sartorial cohesion.

Marcella, or piqué as it is otherwise known, is the style of weave. The shirt should have a turned-down collar and double cuffs.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Tie&nbsp;</strong>- A black bow tie is traditional, although there is leeway here to play with the colour palette. The only colour that is off limits is white.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Jacket&nbsp;</strong>- A black-tie occasion calls for a dinner jacket, usually in black wool. The piece should have satin or grosgrain lapels, echoed in a similar stripe along the outer seam of the trousers.</li><li><strong>Trousers&nbsp;</strong>- Trousers should match the dinner jacket in colour, be carefully pressed, and naturally taper to fit the body. Traditionally, trousers feature a single satin braid along the outer leg.</li><li><strong>Shoes&nbsp;</strong>- Black, patent and smart. As a general rule of thumb, go for opera pumps or Oxfords.</li></ul><p id=ekz2SCKTEsYp data-wc=15><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How to wear feathers: 9 outfit ideas to give you some serious style inspiration</a></p><p id=eCeBWNi4lXmj data-wc=13><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>'Tis the season for cocktail attire: 8 pieces that exude festive glam</a></strong></p><h2>Black-tie for women</h2><p id=exlvky_GFBFk data-wc=25>For women however, the dress code can (unhelpfully) be interpreted far more broadly, although generally the vibe you want to aim for is 'evening-appropriate opulence'.</p><p id=elTT137VJf data-wc=21>Samantha Benveniste, fashion designer and founder of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Benveniste Couture</a>, feels that black-tie presents the perfect opportunity to channel Old Hollywood glamour.&nbsp;</p><p id=efYnn_9NkBC data-wc=29>"Personally, I see it as formal in the sense of a silver screen goddess," she tells <a class=hm-link href=#>Hello! Fashion</a>. "An opportunity to embrace the feminine and exude witty charm shamelessly."</p><p id=ePqYlzgRdTwY data-wc=29>"When thinking about what to wear, learn toward the classic, sparkling or sculptural pieces, staying away from anything resembling daywear. Silk, satin, chiffon and lace are all&nbsp;black-tie&nbsp;winners."</p><p id=e--BjXXvWDC6 data-wc=40>A sleek evening dress is a failsafe option – think fabrics that exude a certain dressiness, discounting anything that feels too 'everyday', garish or short. But don't feel bound by tradition – a chic suit would also be perfectly permissible.</p><h2>How we chose:</h2><p id=egWebZecn2- data-wc=39><strong>Black-tie appropriate:&nbsp;</strong>The fashion buys we've included below all have a distinctly formal, elegant vibe and would comfortably slip into a black-tie ensemble. We've leaned into fabrics that feel suitable for evening, and taken into account cuts and lengths.&nbsp;</p><p id=e9CKqASxkJZa data-wc=10><a class=hm-link href=#>Hello!

Do embrace the maxi length</strong></h3><p id=e-NkBS860H4n data-wc=60>Rest assured, we adore Miu Miu's micro skirt just as much as the next fashion insider, but there is a time and place. A short length cocktail dress may cut it if your host isn’t bound by tradition, but we recommend you err on the side of caution and opt for a floor-length or midi piece where black-tie is concerned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/16c1d3128019-galvan-gown.jpg><h3><strong>2. Don't leave it to the last minute</strong></h3><p id=elIjVUTstSGGx data-wc=47>Unlike some other dress codes, nailing black-tie generally requires some sartorial prep. We suggest you try out some options in-person (retro, we know), as it's typically super difficult to gauge how the fit, length or cut of a dress will look on your body when shopping online.</p><p id=e0sEMOnDgsmnO data-wc=53>If this is not an option, don't panic – order a few different options that you can try on at home, leaving enough time so that if disaster strikes and it doesn't quite fit right you can call on a trusty tailor to make an adjustment or go back to the drawing board. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3. Do consider the occasion</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/296dec139191-gettyimages-1493320462.jpg><p id=eVkkgzQV8n1r8 data-wc=64>Not all black-tie events were created equal – think long and hard about the occasion you are set to attend. Is it a sit-down dinner, outdoor wedding reception or illustrious charity gala? Determining whether you will be consuming six courses, posing for pictures on an uneven lawn or waltzing across the ballroom are all major factors that will influence what you decide to wear.</p><p id=eKGPOz1fCjGji data-wc=12><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>10 of the best silk shirts to wear all party season</a></strong></p><p id=eo3GHc8b_B6 data-wc=12><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Mini and micro bags are the cutest accessory trend right now</a></p><p id=esiJq6poBjFoH data-wc=50>"Wear something you have worn before, even in your own home," Samantha advises. "Move in it, sit in it - make sure there are no fit issues. It is hard to enjoy yourself if you are not comfortable and fidgeting can take the glamour away from the most beautiful ensemble."</p><h3><strong>4. Don't neglect your outerwear</strong></h3><p id=eWAwjPTWvvUU8 data-wc=46>It would be a terrible shame to dampen your Cinderella moment with an unsightly puffer or a run-of-the-mill trench. Remember to consider the journey to and from the party, perhaps by splashing out on a luxe 'Old money'-style faux fur or investing in a chic overcoat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/19dd228caa33-white-fluffy-jacket.jpg><h3><strong>5. Do bring your footwear A-game</strong></h3><p id=eXWq0t_QlLnzT data-wc=41>Even if your dress skims the floor, don't allow your footwear to fall by the wayside. This season we are head over heels for embellished&nbsp;styles by Amina Muaddi, satin slingbacks by Jennifer Chamandi and mesh lace designs by Manolo Blahnik.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/038c2dafddf2-amina-muaddi-clear-heels.jpg><h3><strong>6. Don't overcomplicate it&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=e5yqWBb__ULC2 data-wc=62>Creative consultant and Vogue Hong Kong contributor <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Olivia Buckingham</a> feels that the key to nailing black-tie is all about balance. "If it’s heavily embellished then you want to perhaps go more minimal on jewellery and shoes, whereas if the outfit is on the plainer side I say go big," Olivia explains. "I love Alessandra Rich's statement earrings and Benedetta Bruzziches' crystal clutches."</p><h3><strong>7. Don't feel obliged to stick to black</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/3fe122019c32-gettyimages-1151279824.jpg><p id=ebckWJAzXAEvY data-wc=41>Granted, we live and die by the <a class=hm-link href=#>LBD</a>, but black-tie certainly doesn't mean you are bound to one particular hue.
