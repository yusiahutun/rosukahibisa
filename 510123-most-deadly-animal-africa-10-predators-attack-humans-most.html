Due to habitat encroachment, there is increasing human-wildlife conflict leading to fatalities.</p><h2>10 most deadly animals in Africa</h2><p class=align-left>The continent is home to different species of animals. However, despite the pristine landscape and wildlife, the continent hosts some of the deadliest animals. Here are some of the most deadly animals in Africa, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">according to Travel Awaits</a>:</p><h3>1. Nile crocodile</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d0cdd15bb56f2ebb.jpg><p class=align-left>What is the number 1 deadliest animal? Crocodiles are some of the deadliest animals that have survived various evolutionary changes dating over <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">200 million years ago</a>. The reptiles are found in almost every major African water body or river and are ferocious predators.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e917478ccae806c9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Syrians turn plastic waste into rugs to make a living</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Nile crocodiles are dangerous freshwater predators responsible for over 1000 human deaths annually. They are stealthy creatures that wait in ambush for anything within their reach. Crocodile attacks happen indiscriminately in African villages that utilize rivers to quench their water needs, often leaving fatalities.</p><h3>2. African lion</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e917478ccae806c9.jpg><p class=align-left>The African lion, classified as one of The Big Five on safaris, is one of the most dangerous animals in the <a href=#>world</a>. Lions are apex predators that inhabit and roam the African jungle. They are responsible for over 200 human casualties annually.</p><p class=align-left>They hunt by using their tough inclined canines to take down prey. Lions are also known to assert dominance and attack anything it perceives as a threat. Unfortunately, due to human encroachment into<a href=#> wildlife habitats</a>, human-wildlife conflicts have often recurred with devasting effects.</p><h3>3. Hippopotamus</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/28c893edac4cf077.jpg><p class=align-left>Herbivorous hippopotamus could easily be mistaken as unthreatening creatures for their cute and bubbly demeanour.

Hippopotamus are surprisingly fast for creatures of their body mass and agile in and out of water. They are hot temper aggressive and charge at random.</p><p class=align-left>Most hippo-human attacks occur at night as they come out to feed. They are armed with razor-sharp, half-meter teeth that arch up to 150 degrees and are among the top 10 predators that attack humans.</p><h3>4. African elephant</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/303e4a50db5493fc.jpg><p class=align-left>The African elephant is the largest land mammal on earth, standing over 10 feet tall.

An elephant is one of the most dangerous mammals in Africa and attacks humans unprovoked by charging at speeds and trampling anything in their path.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2824ca7a96919abf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Finland's nuclear catacombs nearly ready to house waste</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Territorial male elephants are incredibly aggressive during mating seasons when their <a href=#>testosterone levels are inflated</a>.

Rhinoceros</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/515a6d85f4c224c2.jpg><p class=align-left>Rhinos are not predators but are considered Africa's most dangerous land mammals for their aggressive demeanour.

They are responsible for over 200 human deaths annually, and habitat encroachment has increasingly led to human-wildlife conflict.</p><p class=align-left>Rhinos are also poached for their horns and sold to Asian markets for alleged medicinal purposes. Extensive poaching has led to dwindling Rhino populations, with black rhinos listed as critically endangered and the white rhino extinct.</p><h3>6. Puff adder</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3d2b83b67437527e.jpg><p class=align-left>The puff adder is a deadly viper in Africa with potent venom that releases potent cytotoxic toxins.

This snake causes<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> 32,000 human deaths</a> annually, more than any other African snake recording over 90% of all snake bites. A puff adder bite sends through blistering pain followed by swelling and severe tissue haemorrhage if untreated with an antivenom within hours.</p><h3>7. Black mamba</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2824ca7a96919abf.jpg><p class=align-left>The black mamba is one of Africa's fastest reptiles, attaining top speeds of 20km/h.

Ferocious predators, black mambas inhabit rocky hills and open savannas of south and eastern Africa, growing up to 14 feet in length.</p><h3>8. Leopard</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/06f110a65b826c71.jpg><p class=align-left>The Leopard is part of the big cat <a href=#>family</a> and inhabits the African savanna plainlands.

Although human-leopard encounters are rare, they have occurred due to <a href=#>prolonged drought </a>and leopard habitat encroachment.</p><p class=align-left>As civilizations expand, humans encroach into more leopard territory for residential and agricultural land use. Human–leopard attacks are becoming frequent and responsible for over 30 deaths annually.</p><h3>9. Hyena</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2624aae2bf98d92a.jpg><p class=align-left>The hyena is a scavenger native to the African sub-continent. The hyena is not a natural predator rather, the carnivore fends and scavenges on the carcasses of other animals maintaining the delicate wildlife ecosystem.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike other scavengers, the hyena possesses powerful jaws that can crush, break down bones and tear apart flesh. In Africa, hyenas are responsible for some 300 annual human deaths as they encroach into <a href=#>human settlements </a>to feed on livestock, and the ensuing conflict leaves fatalities as collateral.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/497701549c7d716a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is the scariest thing in the world?
