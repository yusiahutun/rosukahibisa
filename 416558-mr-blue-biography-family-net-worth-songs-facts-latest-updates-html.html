He has three siblings. He attended Prison School and completed his primary education in 1999. He later enrolled at Dar es Salaam Secondary but dropped out of school in 2004 while in Form 2.</p><p class=align-left>Sameer attributes his hunger for becoming an artist as the reason why he quit attending school. From time to time, he had to sing to make money to pay school fees. Eventually, he chose music. Mr Blue's parents did not try to stop him nor force him back to school. They thought he was becoming a stubborn teenager and that he would get over the music dream.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/95357fa62c23a8df.jpg><h2>His wife and children</h2><p class=align-left>Mr Blue found love in his stunning wife, Wayhda Byser, at a pub while having random drinks.

But, people still assume that Najma and Mr Blue's relationship is not entirely over. However, the artist <a href=# title="Mr Blue" rel="nofollow noopener">squashed off rumours</a> claiming that he is madly in love with his wife and mother of his kids.</p>Hatua za kisheria lazima zichukuliwe unajua hivi vitu sio vitu vya kuharibiana, mi sa hivi nishakuwa mtu mzima, siwezi kurudia matapishi ambayo nishawahi kuyatapika, eti nikampigie Najma sijui niwe nae, kwa sababu mimi najua mke wa kumuoa najua mwanamke wa kuwa naye ndio maana nikamchagua mke wangu, na nampenda na amenizalia watoto wazuri, kwa hiyo siwezi tena kufikiria eti kumpigia Najma.<p class=align-left>The Tanzanian artist maintains a low profile on matters ‘family’ on social media.

He further explained that when you become older, these things are no longer important. However, the artist has always been passionate about music. Concerning any past behaviour that he regrets, here is what the Tanzanian <a href=#>rapper</a> had to say:</p>I started being mischievous a long time ago. I pierced my ears while I was still in class seven. I think I might leave singing later in life and forget about music. I do not like my tattoos and I do not enjoy seeing my ears pierced.

Although he is established, there are decisions that he made as a young man that he's not very proud of currently. However, he does not dwell on his past mistakes.
