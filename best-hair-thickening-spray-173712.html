No matter the cause, be it aging, stress, or hormonal changes, thinning hair is something that many women deal with. In fact, the Cleveland Clinic reports that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>30 million women</a> suffer from <a href=#>hair loss</a> each year. Luckily, there are plenty of products out there that can help you regain your hair confidence, including this one that women can’t seem to put down: <strong>Kevin Murphy</strong><a href=#><strong>‘</strong></a><strong>s Body Mass spray</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>$38.74, Amazon</strong></a><strong> or locate a salon </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>)</strong> .&nbsp;</p><p>Promising to boost thickness and increase body and bounce, this leave-in <a href=#>thickening spray</a>, which is part of the company’s <a href=#>Plumping line</a>, is in a league of its own. Its secret lies in its unique combination of wheat protein, hair-fortifying oleanolic acid (a hair growth compound derived from the lovely hemsleya root), and biotin — three ingredients that are commonly seen in<a href=#> eyelash thickeners and lengtheners</a>. The idea here is that by using these ingredients on your head, you’ll have the same result as you would when used on your lashes, i.e., increased circulation, and in turn, hair growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from this trio of hair-boosters, this spray also comes packed with a superstar blend of baobab (known to repair and soften hair), immortelle (known for its anti-aging and strengthening benefits), and açai (known for promoting hair growth and shine) fruit extracts. This gorgeous concoction of extracts is also the thing behind Body Mass’ delectable scent.&nbsp;</p><p>Sulfate, paraben, and cruelty-free, this spray also doubles as a<a href=#> heat protectant</a> that will shield locks from the damaging effects of hot tools up to 420 degrees! (For reference, most hot tools, such as <a href=#>curling irons</a> and straighteners, go up to 400 degrees).&nbsp;</p><p>To use Body Mass, start by prepping your hair with a good wash; Kevin Murphy also makes a great thickening shampoo ($33.79, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Amazon</a>) and rinse ($35, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Amazon</a>). Then apply the spray onto your damp or towel-dried hair, concentrating it at the roots and scalp. From there, all that’s left to do is to style your hair as you normally would and bask in the glory of your newly thick, voluminous tresses.<br>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/kevin-murphy-body-mass.png><p>FIRST’s own editorial director Lili Zarghami is a fan of this spray, sharing, “The leave-in plumping treatment was great for [my] limp winter hair. I sprayed it at the roots as directed after I towel-dried my hair. The smell is so delicious and it felt really weightless.”</p><p>As for what others are saying, one happy customer raved, “This is the best hair product I’ve ever tried! I have [polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)] and a thyroid disease, so I struggle with brittle hair and lots of thinning. I spray two to three [squirts] of this on my hair after I’ve towel dried it and then let it air dry. This instantly gives the hair volume and a great scent. I’ve noticed a significant decrease in my shedding and my hair looks voluminous and full. I will definitely be repurchasing this!”</p><p>Best of all, this spray also has the hairdresser seal of approval, with one hair professional writing, “I am a hairdresser and I have heard it all when it comes to helping thin balding hair, this product is the real deal. I have seen this product change people’s hair and their perspective on life — hair can make or break someone [and] this product helps with that.”</p><p><strong>Where to buy: </strong><a href=#><strong>$38.74, Amazon</strong></a></p><p>This story originally appeared on our sister site, <a rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>Woman’s World</a>.</p><p>See more of our <a href=#><strong>best product recommendations</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJomZ6ZpanGcK7ErKtmoJGev27Ax6KapJ2enruoedKpqZqxXWaEdIOQaw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
