Mind blowing, I know. The woman in question is Saint Lucy of Syracuse who was killed during the Diocletianic Persecution of 304 AD, and whose feast day is celebrated on 13 December.&nbsp;</p><p id=egDzPJ0hnw data-wc=50>The first European settlers were French - and so when they allegedly ended up shipwrecked on the island on the Feast of Saint Lucy (13 December), they named the island country "Sainte Alousie" in her honour. The island later earned the moniker "Santa Lucia" when Spanish explorers arrived in 1511.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c361f7c59b62-st-lucia-landings-beach.jpg><p id=eCm896lksm5 data-wc=72>With its tropical rainforests, sparkling seas and arresting mountain peaks, it's easy to see why the lush isle has since become a tourist hotspot. In a bid to see what all the fuss was about, I hot-footed it to the Caribbean island where I had the pleasure of staying at <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Landings Resort and Spa</a> located in Rodney Bay.

Each bedroom has its own en-suite bathroom splashed with marble, while in the open-plan living room and kitchen, guests are treated to a full designer kitchen, a dining area and a lounge area with a large sofa and three armchairs to boot. Warm woods, rattan furnishings and smatterings of bamboo permeate the villa, creating a tranquil space with plenty of character.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="13 best holidays to go on with babies and toddlers in 2024" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c9a1eaa8448a-best-holidays-with-kids.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="13 best holidays to go on with babies and toddlers in 2024" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>13 best holidays to go on with babies and toddlers in 2024</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="13 of the best luxury spa breaks in the UK" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d29126a79522-spa-feature-5.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="13 of the best luxury spa breaks in the UK" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>13 of the best luxury spa breaks in the UK</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="How a solo holiday helped me reset" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/7afb349029d1-leo-pool.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="How a solo holiday helped me reset" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>How a solo holiday helped me reset</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e2wqChIWdcN data-wc=45>Outside, a private plunge pool awaits, surrounded by a sizable outdoor dining area and two sun loungers.
