You’re coming away from the shaky and erratic energy of the Jupiter-Uranus conjunction, and as unexpected transitions continue to play out for the next few weeks, anything can happen. Drama has been at a fever pitch lately, but it’s all clearing away blockages that have been inhibiting your freedom.</p><p>The week kicks off with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Taurus sun</a> forming a tense square <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to Pluto in Aquarius</a> on April 21. Since Pluto is the planet of transformation and rebirth, this could irritate the parts of yourself that remain inflexible to change. It could your overwhelm sense of security by pushing you out of your comfort zone and forcing you to see the world through a new lens. Life-altering information is being brought forward and your usual instincts are being challenged. I don’t know about you, but I’m already feeling uncomfortable (and slightly scared)!</p><p>This will be immediately followed by a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">full Pink Moon in Scorpio</a>. This fixed water sign is concerned with uncovering secrets, discovering hidden truths, and maintaining control. That means this full moon should shine a light on hidden agendas, making everyone’s true intentions known. Prepare for shocking revelations to come to light. If you play your cards right, this powerful new source of information could not only benefit you, but the world at large.</p><p>You’ll want to take a load off by April 25, because things will start to lighten up as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mercury retrograde finally comes to an end</a> at exactly 8:53 a.m. ET. Stationing direct at 15 degrees of Aries, this retrograde was particularly tiresome, as Aries is a zodiac sign with a whole lot of pride, which is one reason it led to an influx of ego-driven disagreements. And because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mars—Aries’ fiery planetary ruler</a>—was sitting beside inhibiting Saturn for the duration of this retrograde, it’s likely that you’ve felt stuck between a rock and a hard place. Luckily, that post-retrograde clarity is about to hit, so get ready for all that pressure to become a diamond.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-planets-will-affect-your-zodiac-sign-this-week>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This Week</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming week, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising&nbsp;sign</a>&nbsp;(and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.2341417910448><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_aries.png><p>You may be struggling to give up something that matters to you in order to put your trust in something larger than yourself this week.
