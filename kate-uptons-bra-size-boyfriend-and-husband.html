Just like Taylor Swift for her harem of ex-boyfriends, Dwayne the Rock Johnson for his bulging muscles, and Prince for his high heels, Kate Upton is for her busty mammary glands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kate-Upton1.jpg><p>Kate Upton’s bra size is currently 34 D, and given the fact that she grew from 32 B in 2008 to 34 D about three years later, many people believe that she has had implants.</p><p>The model in question said this in connection with the rumors that have been circulating: “The things they reject are things I can’t change, I can’t change my bra size. They are NATURAL! I can train and I can stay healthy and motivated, but some things I cannot change. I really just live my life. I love my body.

She can’t help but feel bad about the fact that she can’t go less bra in a spaghetti thong top and/or for the smallest bikini design. Nevertheless, she loves her body, her curves, her breasts, and everything else.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kate Upton’s Boyfriend</strong></h2><p>This theme must be taken up and upgraded to “Kate Upton’s fiancée”.

Upton even started dating Maksim Chmerkovskiy, but they split up in December 2013, and a month later she was seen with Verlander again.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who is Ben Affleck Dating?
