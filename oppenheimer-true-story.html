The tutor didn't eat the apple – but Oppenheimer's place at Cambridge was threatened, maintained only on the condition that he see a psychiatrist.

Roosevelt to head up the secretive 'Manhattan Project' laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico during World War II. On 16 July 1945, with a team of accomplished scientists, Oppenheimer launched the world’s first atomic bomb test in the Jornada del Muerto desert in New Mexico. The blast, codenamed 'Trinity', outshone the sun: with a force matching 21 kilotonnes of TNT, the detonation was the largest ever seen, and created a shockwave that was felt 100 miles away. It was then that he became known for having uttered <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230712-robert-oppenheimer-manhattan-project-nuclear-scientist-atomic-bomb data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the now-famous phrase" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the now-famous phrase</a>, "I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds" – a quote from Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the rest of his life, Oppenheimer seemed to wrestle with his involvement in creating the atomic bomb.
