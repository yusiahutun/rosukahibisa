Couri Hay who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> People, he gave it to her a day early.</p><p>The star would have been celebrating her 77th birthday on Monday, October 16, a day before her death.</p><p>“She read the poem and went to bed and later died peacefully in her sleep,” he revealed. The emotional love poem was revealed to the publication, which read:</p><p>“Love I use it every day, sometimes several times a day. I use it at the end of emails to my loving family. I even use it in emails to close friends. I use it when I’m leaving the house,” the note read.</p><p>“There’s love, then love you and I love you!! Therein lies some of the different ways we use love. Sometimes I feel obliged to use love, responding to someone who signed love in their email, when I’m uncomfortable using love but I use it anyway.</p><p>“I also use love to describe a great meal. I use it to express how I feel about a show on Netflix. I often use love referring to my home, my cat Gloria, to things Gloria does, to the taste of a cantaloupe I grew in my garden. I love the taste of a freshly harvested organic royal jumbo medjool date.</p><p>“I love biting a fig off the tree. I love watching two giant blackbirds who live nearby swooping by my window in a power dive. My daily life encompasses things and people I love and things and people I am indifferent to,” he continued.</p><p>“I could go on ad infinitum, but you get it. What brand of love do I feel for my my wife Suzanne? Can I find it in any of the above? A resounding no!!!! There is no version of the word that is applicable to Suzanne and I even use the word applicable advisedly.</p><p>“The closest version in words isn’t even close. It’s not even a fraction of a fraction of a fraction. Unconditional love does not do it. I’ll take a bullet for you doesn’t do it. I weep when I think about my feelings for you. Feelings… That’s getting close, but not all the way.</p><p>“55 years together, 46 married and not even one hour apart for 42 of those years. Even that doesn’t do it,” he added. “Even going to bed at 6 o’clock and holding hands while we sleep doesn’t do it. Staring at your beautiful face while you sleep doesn’t do it.</p><p>“I’m back to feelings. There are no words. There are no actions. No promises. No declarations. Even the green-shaded scholars of the Oxford University Press have spent 150 years and still have failed to come up with that one word. So I will call it, ‘Us,’ uniquely, magically, indescribably wonderful ‘Us,’” the 87-year-old concluded.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-s-relationship-explored>The couple’s relationship explored</h2><p>Suzanne and Alan first met all the way back in 1969, on the set of TV show, The Anniversary Game, where she worked as a model, while Hamal hosted.</p><p>In 1977, the couple tied the knot, and as well as being her life partner, the host also became his wife’s manager in the early 80s.</p><p>The couple never had children together, however, became parents to each other’s children. Suzanne has a son, Bruce, from her marriage with Bruce Somers, which came to an end a year before meeting Alan.</p><p>Somers also became stepmom to Hamel’s two children, Stephen and Leslie Hamel.</p><p>Just four months before her death, Alan announced that his wife’s cancer had returned, shortly before Suzanne gave her <a href=#>Instagram</a> followers a <a href=#>health</a> update, saying the two are “closer than ever.”</p><p>“I know how to put on my battle gear and I’m a fighter. Alan has been by my side every step of the way. I can’t even explain how much he has done for me. If it’s even possible, we are even closer than ever,” she penned in part of the caption.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aDcL%2FIrZqopV2esLC60mafrquSlruledarpq2dXZ2ys3nAZqOorpViuabA056pZqCfqr%2B0ecGenaiqlWLBs63GoppmnJWWwal7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
