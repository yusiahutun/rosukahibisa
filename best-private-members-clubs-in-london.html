From BAFTA parties to royal wedding anniversaries, a small selection of London clubs are the playground for the coolest A-listers on the planet.&nbsp;</p><p id=emZj0GBhlr data-wc=44>Nowadays there are so many private clubs to choose from, which still require a thorough application process. But whether you're thinking of joining or just want some insider info, the following clubs are the ones you need to have on your radar in 2024.</p><p id=ewb_4yiYpc data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Beyonce dined at Oswald's: We peek inside London’s most exclusive members club</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=enaHHNfxRO data-wc=9><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>9 unapologetically pink restaurants to visit in London</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Home House</strong></h2><p id=edTvtz7IuIi data-wc=76>Established in the 18th century and designed by King George III's own architect James Wyatt, Home House's Georgian Townhouse home in Marylebone fuses "18th century splendour with 21st century style." The three-stoey houses included restaurants, bars, drawing rooms, a boutique gym and health spa, elegant bedrooms, opulent private dining rooms and a courtyard garden. Whilst it's renowned for its iconic members parties, members can also enjoy events from the best of arts, culture, food and drink.</p><p id=etaUboRYHY data-wc=4><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>20 Portman Square, Marylebone</a></p><h2 data-gid=eYja4dd-La dir=auto><strong data-gid=ej_ICAZ1Du8>Pavillion Club</strong></h2><p id=eEVfFYWOcV data-wc=70>Pavilion Club has not one, but three luxury workspaces with private members' facilities in the sought-after locations of Kensington, the City and Knightsbridge. Its flagship club, Pavilion Knightsbridge, is steeped in history - originally built for the London & Country Bank back in 1884, the building has been restored and transformed into an Art-Deco-inspired haven spread across four floors. What's more, there's a stunning roof terrace which overlooks Hyde Park.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebmPXm7tmJl data-wc=2><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>64 Knightsbridge</a></p><h2>Dartmouth House</h2><p id=elx-l9T8C5 data-wc=80>Dartmouth House opened in the heart of Mayfair in June 2023. Members of the House have exclusive open access to Dartmouth House’s Grade II-listed Georgian building on Charles Street - opened by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin in February 1927. The house, which is also the home of the English-Speaking Union (ESU) - &nbsp;a charity that supports young people of different cultures to build their speaking and listening skills, features a bar, lounge, a unique marble courtyard and stunning Georgian surroundings.</p><p id=e3773qxmh6Z data-wc=4><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>37-38 Charles St</a><strong>, Mayfair</strong></p><h2 data-gid=efAOSBrtVu><strong data-gid=ewb0pWz8T4R>Allbright Mayfair</strong></h2><p id=ecMpHDvE6b data-wc=80>Allbright is more than a private member's club - there's a serious mission at heart. The female-only club based in a townhouse in Mayfair, houses the world’s largest collective of women in business. "We enable ambition in all its forms, supporting women at every stage of their development," it says on its website. Alongside a stunning five-floor clubhouse on Maddox Street with two roof terraces, members and non-members can book everything from Allbright events to private dinners to Yoga classes.</p><p id=emN9of_i6Um data-wc=4><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>24-26 Maddox St, Mayfair</a></p><h2 dir=auto><strong>House of Koko</strong></h2><p id=eEgNPCNvjL data-wc=57>The House of Koko in Camden opened its doors in March 2022 after its long-awaited debut was postponed because of the Coronavirus pandemic. What used to be a concert venue and former theatre, the 123-year-old building has been revived to become north London's chicest venue with an impressive line-up of events, from launch parties to panel discussions. &nbsp;</p><p id=erXqHkkHZt data-wc=4><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>74 Crowndale Road, Camden</a></p><h2 dir=auto><strong>5 Hertford Street</strong></h2><p id=euHfly-Yqf2 data-wc=89>Went 5 Hertford Street (or, 5H as it's known) first opened in 2021, Mick Jagger and Kate Moss made an appearance during the first week. Owned by Robin Birley (the son of Annabel's founder Mark Birley), the most exclusive guests from Leonardo di Caprio to Boris Johnson have made appearances at the incredibly private venue, though One Direction famously got rejected in 2013. The club downstairs Loulou's is named after Birley's aunt and fashion designer Loulou de la Falaise is equally as luxurious and alluring as it is exclusive.</p><p id=enO_gSpfIy data-wc=4><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>5 Hertford Street, Mayfair</a></p><h2 dir=auto><strong>Annabel’s</strong></h2><p id=e5poeWJTUy data-wc=57>Perhaps the most recognised of the clubs, Annabel's has been the place to be since 1963. In 2018 it opened the doors to its much-anticipated new home, a Grade I listed Georgian mansion house at 46 Berkeley Square. The club has six restaurants, and everybody from The Supremes to Lady Gaga has performed inside the 26,000-square-foot venue.</p><p id=ethHmsOAxR data-wc=4><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>46 Berkeley Square, Mayfair</a></p><h2 dir=auto><strong>Apollo’s Muse</strong></h2><p id=eOAt-rqUHK data-wc=71>We'd argue that if there was a private members club's interiors awards, Apollo's Muse would take the crown. Just three months after Bacchanalia opened its doors in December 2022, Richard Caring officially opened Apollo’s Muse in March - the private members club that is housed within the walls of the stunning Greco-Italian concept restaurant. Olivier Rousteing recently hosted a Balmain dinner and Machine Gun Kelly hosted a party there in May.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_aWCbIxRL data-wc=4><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>1 Mount Street,&nbsp;Mayfair</a></p><h2 dir=auto><strong>George</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f50fbda995a2-screenshot-2023-06-21-172522.jpg><p id=eI4Bb40XEf data-wc=57>Founded in 2001, George is a contemporary club, restaurant and bar that reopened this spring. The club exudes style and is dog-friendly. What more could you ask for? It's Richard Caring's latest opening that boasts a ground-floor dining room with works by David Hockney hung on the walls, an outdoor terrace and an art deco downstairs bar.</p><p id=eO2MhBx0ip data-wc=4><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>88-89 Mount Street, Mayfair</a></p><h2 dir=auto><strong>Maison Estelle</strong></h2><p id=ej6yC_ivY5s data-wc=59>House in a Grade II building on Grafton Street, this is arguably Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie's favourite hangout spot. The owners are the hospitality group Ennismore, who also own Gleneagles in Scotland. The building is a huge 24,000 square feet and includes three restaurants, 10 distinct bars, a library/study, and a nightclub, each room with its own designs.</p><p id=exEp2wdsrt data-wc=4><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>6 Grafton Street, Mayfair</a></p><h2 dir=auto><strong>Oswald's</strong></h2><p id=eAoYcdaT4Z data-wc=86>You may recognise this name as <a class=hm-link href=#>Beyonce and Jay-Z went here</a> for date night during her London Renaissance tour. One of the newer venues on London's private club roster, Oswald’s was opened in 2018 by Robin Birley - the 64-year-old businessman who also owns 5 Hertford Street. Birley is the second son of Lady Annabel Goldsmith, from her marriage to Mark Birley – the late club owner who founded the world-famous Annabels. Birley's grandfather Sir Oswald was a royal portraitist who the club is named after.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHDff0cNyS data-wc=4><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>25 Albermarle Street, Mayfair.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5Nya21vYGSvpr%2FTZqeroaaWwaZ5zJ6km52iqHqkuNSbqmahnmK5sLrDqKVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
