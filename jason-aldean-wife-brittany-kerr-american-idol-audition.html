As the blonde beauty walked into the room, Aerosmith's Tyler was immediately smitten.</p><p>"I say yes!" he exclaimed upon meeting her gaze. When asked what song she would be singing for Tyler, Jackson and Jennifer Lopez, a soft spoken Kerr&nbsp;responded that she'd prepared Joss Stone's "Spoiled."

I liked that," Jackson said, stopping her after the first verse. While Lopez remarked that "she's adorable," Tyler agreed but urged&nbsp;Kerr to sing more powerfully.</p><p>"I think that's good. I like it. I liked your melody. You're on pitch and you're good lookin,'" he told her. "You just gotta push it out a little bit more.

Kerr was one of 301 singers that made it to Hollywood, but only 98 contestants advanced after that.</p><p>While she may not have become the winner on American Idol, she did win Aldean's heart!
