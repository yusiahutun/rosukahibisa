He didn't want it and wasn't searching for that but it presents itself and he gets very excited," he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cd8dcc602907-1708300332.jpg><p id=e6qT1c7YpH data-wc=49>"They have this whole experience together and it's so cool – and then it's over. Shutting down is one of his coping mechanisms. It is how he has survived, by compartmentalizing but things are compounding; everything from what he has learned about his childhood to the death of Cricket.&nbsp;</p><p id=eOVrYGzhBR data-wc=35>"It all has an effect, psychologically, emotionally, but he keeps burying everything under the rug but when it [eventually] all comes out? That will be interesting because he has been taking one hit after another."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/048d32133107-1657243154v1.jpg><p id=eFN-7QCoc1 data-wc=36>"I would hope so," he continued when asked by his co-star Erika Christensen, who plays Angie Polaski, if perhaps there is some value to be found in the short time Will and Cricket had their connection.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYsZK9FzkW data-wc=18>"Will is someone that doesn't open himself up to those opportunities and this one surprised him," Ramon added.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a9a662b828c5-1660160450.jpg><p id=eUQRSHOgAd data-wc=34>Elsewhere in the episode, it was revealed that Angie's police partner Michael Ormewood (played by Jake McLaughlin) was concerned that his wife was cheating on him, only for his worst fear to be true.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7LcdlaEKD data-wc=24>With Ormewood now facing the realization that his marriage may be falling apart, Erika shares that the dynamic between these two will also change.&nbsp;</p><p id=eJ4uSsceUM data-wc=49>"Police partnerships really are a rather intimate relationship; within the confines of this circumstance you have to spend so much time together in a professional capacity, but you end up getting to know everything about each other's lives and the dirty little secrets come forth," the Parenthood actress said.&nbsp;</p><p id=ejWO7HSMj_ data-wc=49>"In season one, Faith tried to get on at Ormewood, saying, 'You have some responsibility for this person, you know?' and in season two, Angie will start to realize maybe she has to be there for him, and not just say, 'Get out of my face,' all the time."</p><p id=eP0cb6NRE_ data-wc=6>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
