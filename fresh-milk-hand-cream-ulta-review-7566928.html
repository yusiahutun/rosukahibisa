I do everything right as far as those two are concerned, but the one part of my body that I have neglected is my hands. I always assumed that whatever product I applied to my body would also remedy my hands, but I quickly learned that was far from the truth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Working as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a fashion designer</a> left my hands battered after repeatedly being poked and prodded with needles, and now as a writer, I’m still constantly using my hands to type. My unappreciated palms have begun to peel and crack in ways I have never seen, and with my frequency at the gym, I have some pretty nasty calluses. That’s why I decided to create a skincare routine specifically for my hands, and the star product has been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Fresh's Milk Hand Cream</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-freshs-milk-hand-cream></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Fresh's Milk Hand Cream</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You know that uncomfy, tight feeling you get after you wash your hands and they fully dry? Well, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Fresh's hand cream</a> immediately relieves that feeling. It has a stacked ingredient list infused with plant-based milks like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>centella</a>, rice, and linseed that soothe and strengthen the skin. It also includes skincare gems such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>squalane</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>niacinamide</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>vitamin E</a> to improve the overall appearance of the skin while nourishing, leaving them baby soft. The texture is creamy and lightweight, non-oily, and leaves skin deeply hydrated for up to 24 hours. And not only does the cream benefit your hands, but it's also great for your cuticles, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So how did I turn my calloused-ridden paws into baby-soft palms? Well, I started by applying the same care I do to my face and body to my hands. About three times a week, I exfoliate my hands and give them a good wash, and then I go in with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Fresh's hand cream</a>, massaging it up to my wrists and focusing on my knuckles and calluses. Of course, I top it all off with an SPF. After using this hand cream for a week, there was a noticeable difference in my skin’s texture and appearance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I keep the hand cream stocked in my purse, as well as on my nightstand and in my kitchen and bathroom; basically, whenever my hands start to feel dry, it's always at arm's reach. I love that the scent is clean and light and that you don't need much of it, plus, the dry down is quick, so you aren't left with greasy hands. I am a frequent hand washer, but I've noticed that I don't need to reapply immediately after washing because my hands are still moisturized. I have also found that since using this cream, my cuticles peel less often than they used to. My boyfriend has even been reaching for my hand cream, and it's healed his rough mechanic hands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you are looking to give your hands a little extra TLC, shop <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Fresh's Milk Hand Cream</a> for $21 on Ulta.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xaucrKBdoratt4yhmKecXZi%2Fpq3MZqylrJFiv6bCyJ6uZm9la4N6fpc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
