The story, posted to an anonymous forum on Reddit, detailed a brief interaction with the married couple that resulted in a dispute.
While many found the whole thing comical, there were those on the AITA (Am I The A--hole) thread who questioned OP's (a."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"She said that she was trying to relax before her very full day. I asked her what she was doing today. She said 'I don't know'."</p><p>"This made me laugh," he admitted.

This would probably make me chuckle too, but I'd also probably shut myself up and talk to her about what I could do to make her feel less overwhelmed. You're not laughing at her emotional state. That would be assholeish. I'm going with NAH, but you need to have an open and deep conversation on how you can help support her more. Too little info here to make too many assumptions other than she's clearly overwhelmed."</p><p>However, not everyone thought the whole thing was pure comedy.</p><p>"Comedically it's funny, but clearly your wife feels overwhelmed by her day, whether she knows what's in store for her or not," one Redditor noted. "Seems like something y'all should talk about because I don't see the part of the story where you have a discussion about why getting out of bed feels stressful to her. NTA for laughing but your job here is not done."</p><p>While another observed: "A lot of the time if you don't know what's coming your way that day, it's not because you have nothing to do, it's just that you know you're heading into chaos, which can be overwhelming. You can't plan, you can't really mitigate it, all you can do is react and try to put out the fires."</p><p class=quote-block__text>I feel like the fact you thought to mention your 'hour commute' and how she's a SAHM implies your opinion that her work is less tiring or valuable...</p><p>"No idea if that definitely applies to the wife but her reaction suggests that it could be," they continued. "So while what she said is funny, it's actually a problem. I think I'm going to say NAH but apologise and maybe try to find something nice to do for her, she sounds really unhappy."</p><p>Yet another pointed out the language OP used: "I feel like the fact you thought to mention your 'hour commute' and how she's a SAHM implies your opinion that her work is less tiring or valuable than hers is, which leads me to lean more towards the Soft YTA [You're The A--hole] on this one."</p><p>While another Redditor asked for more information: "You say she’s a SAHM. How many kids, and how old? I nanny 3 very young (toddler & infant) children, and I often have to mentally prepare myself for a long day in which I have no idea what will happen bc kids are kids and they change moods/attitudes allllll the time. My guess is that she knows she has a long day of childcare ahead of her and doesn’t have a mental "plan' for the day, which can also be a source of stress! Your response sounds obtuse at best and I’m leaning Y T A."</p><p>What do you think?</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e9d6fa3d-250f-4b10-9470-a2e18df3fdda data-container-ref=toofab:article:7e6212ac-9643-4d49-9640-a52763e4b436 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1d/5by4/2024/03/20/1dbeaee6a98c4f7ba4dbda43f891208e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty Stock Image</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Woman Explains to 'Heavier' Friend How to Lose Weight — Gets Slammed for Being 'Privileged' But Others Think She Was Right</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j25maWtfncK0rsCnm2akkaq0qb%2BMmqtmq6SWxm6t02afqKWVYrqwudJmrqiqm6G8orCMraZmrJiaeqK8z6WYrquVYrynecinq56qnprBcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
