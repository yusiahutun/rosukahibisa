Plus, I recently invested in a non-invasive procedure called Sofwave.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Relatively new to the UK, Sofwave is an ultrasound device promising firmer skin and fewer lines without any risks. The technology is fully FDA-cleared for lifting the eyebrows, submental (the area under the chin) and neck, while also reducing fine lines and wrinkles. It works by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a37526913/how-to-increase-collagen/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="stimulating new collagen" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">stimulating new collagen</a> with the principle of controlled injury – that is, telling the body to heal itself. “Sofwave heats the tissues to between 60-70 degrees celsius,” explains Dr. Sophie Shotter, skin and aesthetics expert, and founder of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://illuminateskinclinic.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Illuminate Skin Clinic" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Illuminate Skin Clinic</a> where I tried the treatment. “This denatures ­– or damages – the collagen, stimulating the production of new collagen by the fibroblast cells.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In case you’re unfamiliar, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a37526913/how-to-increase-collagen/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=collagen class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">collagen</a> – the protein our body naturally produces, providing plumpness in our skin – begins to deplete from the age of 25 onwards. Ergo, collagen-stimulating treatments are billed as both preventative and corrective in anti-ageing terms. And Sofwave is the ultimate example of this.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for #SkinSchool: Trialling a Sarah Chapman facial" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2020-01-16-at-12-27-22-1579177668.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Who is Sofwave for?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Someone with mild-to-moderate laxity of the skin will be the best candidate for Sofwave,” Dr. Shotter tells me. At 38-years-old when I tried it, I’d been noticing slight sagging of my skin, though I wasn’t looking to counter this with the use of facial fillers, or anything else more invasive.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I’m not a fan of bracketing people by age in terms of suitability for treatments,” the doctor continues, “because some people in their twenties smoke or have significant UV damage, whereas some people in their seventies have nurtured their skin”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In general, though, the average patient will usually be between ages 40 and 65, with moderate signs of visible skin ageing such as sagging and wrinkles. (Note that Sofwave won’t tackle skin tone, such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a32799913/sun-damage-skin-treatments/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hyperpigmentation caused by sun damage" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">hyperpigmentation caused by sun damage</a>.) However, Dr. Shotter says that professionally she’s seen great results from Sofwave on people with more advanced – though not extensive – sagging and laxity. While at the other end of the scale, “it can be used preventatively in younger patients who want to bank collagen,” she adds.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>What does Sofwave involve?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Firstly, a strong numbing cream is applied to the face and neck, which on me caused some redness but worked effectively. Without this, the pain of the ultrasound would be unbearable. Once numb, the handheld device attached to the Sofwave machine is placed at specific points on the skin in a grid-like pattern. In turn, each section is heated to a strong peak. For me, this was sometimes entirely painless, while other times it smarted to say the least. However, just as a sharp sting began to overwhelm, the device would beep, indicating it be moved to a new section of skin. Dr. Shotter says that her patients usually find the 30-to-45 minute experience comfortable, “although there may be some areas which feel sore”. Whatever your pain threshold, I’d recommend popping paracetamol beforehand.</p><img alt="softwave skin tightening treatment review" title="Softwave skin tightening treatment review" width=1536 height=2048 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/photo-2022-08-10-21-08-59-1673257243.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bridget March</span><p>Bridget with the numbing cream on</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The treatment is extremely safe,” she reassured me, “as the energy penetrates to 1.5mm and not through the deeper tissues where fat and nerves maybe found”. Therefore, there's no need to worry about fat loss from the face – something that naturally happens with age leading to a sunken look.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There is no ‘downtime’, either, though immediately afterwards my skin was a little rose and swollen – but not in a bad way. The redness resembled a post-facial flush, while the swelling gave me a youthful-looking plumpness, which lasted a day or two. “Some people with more sensitive skins find their skin is a little dry for a few days afterwards,” Dr. Shotter notes, though this wasn’t the case for me.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>What results can you expect from Sofwave?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Results appear anywhere from six weeks onwards, and last for nine-to-12 months,” Dr. Shotter confirms. While my immediate boost was temporary, three months afterwards I noticed that my brows seemed more lifted, my jawline felt tighter, and my lower cheeks more taught.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The average lift to the eyebrow in the clinical studies was three-to-four millimetres, which is quite significant,” she says. “People often notice impressive results in the neck and under chin area as well.”</p><img alt="softwave skin tightening treatment review" title="Softwave skin tightening treatment review" width=998 height=635 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2023-01-09-at-14-20-04-1673274022.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Illuminate Skin Clinic</span><p>Bridget before (left), and three months after trying Sofwave (right)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While it may be hard to measure this at home, she says that “the skin should feel firmer and less ‘grabbable’, and you will just look better in the mirror”. It’s this subtlety that appeals to me; personally, I don’t want to change the way I look. Unlike other treatments such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a38949603/preventative-botox/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wrinkle-relaxing injections" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">wrinkle-relaxing injections</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a43653722/dermal-fillers-guide/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dermal fillers" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">dermal fillers</a> which can alter an appearance, Sofwave is here to enhance and ‘prejuvinate’ – by preventing visible signs of ageing and rejuvenating the early ones I have. For an expensive treatment, I'd only recommend it for those serious about collagen banking, not those who want a quick fix.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As Dr. Shotter reminds me, “There is no magic bullet when we talk about aesthetic anti-ageing treatments – no one treatment does everything. But Sofwave is a treatment which is almost universally useful in a treatment plan.” And it’s staying in mine.</p><img alt="sofwave review" title="Sofwave review" width=1179 height=2078 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sofwave-review-650ad1b615c07.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bridget March</span><p>Bridget trying Sofwave for the second time</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Indeed – a year later I have been back for more. This time, I tried Sofwave in tandem with plant-derived exosome therapy (Dr. Shotter uses the brand EXO|E). This popular K-beauty treatment is becoming big news in the UK thanks to its ability to quash inflammation while stimulating collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid production in the skin, when done in conjunction with a treatment that disrupts the skin (think ultrasound; microneedling; laser; etc). It simply involves a serum-like product being applied to the skin pre- and post-treatment (watch below), yet studies show exosomes go a long way at speeding up skin healing as well as amplifying the rejuvenation a procedure delivers.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Exosome therapy with EXO|E" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/exosome-therapy-650ad0f82312a.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While I'm yet to see my longer term results from this second session of Sofwave, I can say this time I experienced zero redness or swelling afterwards, perhaps thanks to the exosome application. Plus, as I knew what was involved, the discomfort felt entirely manageable and it seemed to fly by in half the time (though the clock told me otherwise). Consider me a convert.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sofwave costs £3000 for a full face treatment and £1600 for a half face treatment at both <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://illuminateskinclinic.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Illuminate Skin Clinic" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Illuminate Skin Clinic</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://drsophieshotter.com/contact-us/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="10 Harley Street" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">10 Harley Street</a> where Dr. Sophie Shotter splits her time.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX6i4qrrCmqmeZ5Fpf3V8lXFpcGejpLO4rdWeZKyjmaN6tb7EmqumnZ6perOx1aKcsGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
