Her technical prowess was never in question as she delivered double stops of balance and depth in both the frenetic passages and the steadier ones.
For the solo cadenza, Hahn picked the most familiar version, written by prominent violinist Joseph Joachim, who both premiered the concerto in 1879 and served as Brahms’ quasi consultant during its composition."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The sound palette produced by her 1685 Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume instrument hinted at moments of reflection.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Dreams can always be achieved’: first Latino to lead the New York Phil</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Violin virtuoso Pablo de Sarasate is said to have refused to play the concerto because he didn’t want to “stand on the rostrum, violin in hand and listen to the oboe playing the only tune in the Adagio!” Principal oboist Liang Wang made no bones about his robust, soloistic playing of the opening tune, which was an ideal match for Hahn’s in their sensuous interplay later on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Would more otherworldliness and vulnerability in Hahn’s sound have made for some more magic in the Adagio? Possibly, but it was gorgeous nonetheless.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Where some soloists fancy pushing boundaries, others, like Hahn, won’t have a bar of it. The energy-laden finale was just as impressive for its inherent solidity, peppered with occasional conductor-soloist smiles as they clearly savoured the final Poco più presto romp.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/10/fa210690-c1ac-4b9f-a7da-e8013ffe264e_64f10534.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Had the enthusiastic audience had their way, Hahn may have been in for a very long night of encores. Both extra pieces – a gem from Bach’s Violin Partita No. 2 and Steven Banks’ Through My Mother’s Eyes – were generous and heartfelt.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Serious fireworks followed the intermission in Tchaikovsky’s “Pathétique”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fine viola playing in the Adagio introduction encapsulated the sense of yearning and pathos to come, and when Van Zweden unleashed the violas’ energy, it proved infectious, adding brilliant urgency to much of the Allegro non troppo first movement.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Jaap van Zweden’s Asian encore in Seoul shows Korea’s cultural ambition</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The forcefulness of many of the outbursts, not least the nightmarish one that rudely interrupts the fading moments of the lyrical second theme, was fearsome. Likewise, the fire that Van Zweden sparked in the orchestra brought fabulous string frenzies, razor-sharp brass interjections, and an explosion of B minor misery that was breathtaking.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The waltz-like opening of the Allegro con grazia second movement was played with a lightness and whimsy that contrasted well with the midsection’s pulsating string surges that oozed with yearning.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Allegro molto vivace third movement began with tight and spiky string triplets, and a stormy coda thrilled with thunderous brass, edgy restlessness in the strings, and crisp, wind-like whistles from the woodwind players.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/10/ebcce1c2-a67a-468a-b3b6-21d8cbfb33cd_33f2bd77.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Van Zweden’s immediate segue into the Adagio lamentoso final movement was uncustomary, but did serve to maintain intensity, and – intentionally or not – thwarted any outbreak of applause. That would have detracted from Tchaikovsky’s final symphonic movement, one which, in the hands of the New Yorkers, was full of profound lament and resignation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">New York Philharmonic, Hong Kong Cultural Centre Concert Hall.
