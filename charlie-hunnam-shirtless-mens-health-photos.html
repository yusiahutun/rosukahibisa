&#34;Sons of Anarchy&#34; star Charlie Hunnam covers the December issue of Men's Health (on newsstands now), where he puts his buff bod on display and reveals how he stays ripped.
&#34;I go into the gym and do 75 pull-ups, 75 dips, 150 squats, 150 pushups, and then 20 minutes of ab work,&#34; he tells the magazine. &#34;Done. It takes an hour; I'm in and out. I sweat the whole time."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Done. It takes an hour; I'm in and out. I sweat the whole time."</p><p>"I work out more for the mental than the physical aspect," the 34-year-old actor admits. "I can get slightly dark when I'm not keeping a routine. It's all about feeling healthy and energetic."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/83/o/2014/11/11/83a077fc157155bb91c93ed37b72038e_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Not only does he stay focused in the gym, but he's disciplined in all aspects of life -- especially his career.</p><p>"I was going to finish playing a psychopath who'd just lost his wife, and five days later I'd be on set playing Christian Grey," Hunnam says of why he backed out of the <strong>"Fifty Shades of Grey"</strong> role. "I was like, 'This is going to be a f---ing disaster.'"</p><p>"It was the opposite of how I've tried to ground my career, not stretch myself too thin, and always do my homework," he continues.</p><p>The role later went to<strong> Jamie Dornan</strong> -- see him in action in the first trailer for the flick below:</p><p>The final episode of "Sons of Anarchy" airs December 9 on FX, but Hunnam won't be taking any breaks. He is set to play King Arthur in a six-movie deal under director<strong> Guy Ritchie</strong>, and he also has signed on for upcoming films<strong> "Crimson Peak"</strong> and <strong>"The Mountain Between Us."</strong></p><p>We can't wait to see more of Charlie!</p><p>Don't want to wait?
