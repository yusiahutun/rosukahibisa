That’s why understanding <a href=#>how Pluto in Aquarius will affect your zodiac sign</a> is such a big deal! This tiny but mighty celestial body is responsible for some of this year’s most life-changing astrology—as it’s once again embarking on a once-in-a-lifetime transition into the sign of Aquarius. The cosmic story that begins this month will continue to unfold and evolve over the next twenty years, revealing deep truths and catalyzing massive shifts on both a personal and collective level.</p><p>Named for the Greek god of the underworld, Pluto in astrology <a href=#>symbolizes depth, intensity and mystery</a>, as well as the great cycles of death and rebirth or creation and destruction. This transformational planet has the power to completely metamorphose us from caterpillars to butterflies, bringing alchemy and profound change. On the other hand, it can also be a harbinger of dark obsessions and Machiavellian power struggles.That’s the thing about Pluto—it works in extremes and draws in intensity like the eye of a storm. It represents all that’s clandestinely shrouded beneath the surface, as well as the evidence that eventually comes bubbling up above ground.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-14-1.png><p>Pluto has been transiting down-to-business Capricorn since 2008, so its initial move into airy Aquarius on March 23, 2023 marked the first sign shift for this planet <a href=#>in nearly 15 years</a>. This was Pluto’s first dip into the revolutionary sign of the water bearer since the late 18th century—but in true Pluto fashion, it’ll take time to fully complete this zodiacal transition.</p><p>Thanks to Pluto’s slow orbit and annual retrograde periods, it reverted back to Capricorn on June 11, 2023, but as of Saturday, January 20, 2024, it will move forward into Aquarius once again. However, this is another temporary dip into Aquarius, as Pluto retrogrades back into Capricorn on September 1. Luckily, it will return to Aquarius for good as of November 19, 2024. From there, Pluto will remain in Aquarius until 2043 and 2044—giving the planet a solid two decades to work its transformative magic in <a href=#>the Aquarius-ruled parts of our chart</a>.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>Pluto re-enters Aquarius on January 20 at 7:56 p.m. ET.</p></figure><p>As the furthest planet from the sun in astrology, Pluto is often referred to as a <a href=#>transpersonal or generational planet</a>—as its distant presence is thought to shape things over a longer period of time and have a more notable influence over society at large. In the forward-thinking air sign Aquarius, we’re likely to see Pluto’s transformative power alter the landscape when it comes to matters of technology, innovation and the way we envision the future. Aquarius is the sign <a href=#>that rules groups and community</a>, so we can expect lots of changes and revelations within the greater collective, too. Pluto will only spend a few months of 2023 in Aquarius, but it’ll give us a taste for the energy that’s yet to come, as whatever happens during this sneak peek may <a href=#>foreshadow some of the shifts that lie ahead</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-pluto-in-aquarius-will-affect-each-zodiac-sign>How Pluto in Aquarius Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Pluto in Aquarius is ushering in a new chapter for society over the upcoming decades, but this transit has plenty of personal changes in store for each zodiac sign, too.

Your productivity will make you even more powerful!

Throughout this next chapter of your life, you’ll be contending with the forces of your unconscious mind—exploring your past, your shadow side, and the most far-reaching corners of your psyche. Check yourself when you’re acting on impulse to see if you can uncover a hidden motive, as you’re now learning to discern between your emotions and intuition in a more powerful way than ever before.
