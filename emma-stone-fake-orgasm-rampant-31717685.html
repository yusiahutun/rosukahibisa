The Poor Things star shot to fame after starring in 2010 coming-of-age comedy Easy A, loosely based on Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 1850 novel The Scarlet Letter. Emma’s character Olive had to fake an orgasm so loud during fake sex with her closeted friend Brandon that it shook the walls.
The plan was to make it look as though the pair were sleeping together to get the bullies off Brandon’s back, so the pair decided to simulate sex while at a house party."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Here's what it's going to be like the whole movie, as I'm breathing into an oxygen tank.</p><p>“The crew was like, 'She's going to be a real blast. Wow. Amazing. A 20-year-old having an asthma attack’,” Emma added.</p><p>During that same sex scene, Emma was instructed to “keep smacking” her co-star – and was actually hitting poor actor Dan Byrd. Director Will Gluck revealed: “Emma smacked Dan many times, and initially, as I recall, Emma didn't want to smack him hard. And Dan is just such a trooper, telling her, 'You have to keep smacking me, you have to keep smacking me!'</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31680921.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_JS308691818.jpg><p>“And if you watch the movie, those are real smacks… But the only way that works is if they committed. And that was really fun.”</p><p>The Poor Things star recently revealed she has a nifty shower trick to “wash off” her intimate scenes, following advice given by an intimacy coordinator. Elle McAlpine suggested taking some time for herself after playing Bella Baxter in the new flick, who goes on a journey of sexual discovery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p><b>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters</b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#> <b>here.</b></a></p><p>Elle told Vanity Fair: “It can make you feel quite vulnerable. Your body is an incredibly smart vehicle, but it sometimes doesn’t register what’s fantasy and what’s not.”</p><p>She suggested “bookending her days on set with cold showers” to “wash the day off”. Elle also told the cast and crew: “Yorgos [Lanthimos] hadn’t specified what kind of position we’re going to be using on the day. So it could be a plethora of positions that we try.”</p><p><b>Follow Daily Star on Threads</b><a href=# rel=nofollow> <b>here.</b></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlorKxlo528uK7Is2aepZ2WerTAzqecZp6RoLJuu9GgmKylXaeurrzAp6tma2FsfniCl24%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
