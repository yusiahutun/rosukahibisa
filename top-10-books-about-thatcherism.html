Margaret Thatcher was Britain’s most controversial modern politician. She continues to divide opinion in Britain, and arguments about her legacy are as heated now as they have ever been. To many on the left, she represented a harsh, uncompromising approach to politics: she was confrontational, aggressive and overtly ideological."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She continues to divide opinion in Britain, and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">arguments about her legacy</a> are as heated now as they have ever been. To many on the left, she represented a harsh, uncompromising approach to politics: she was confrontational, aggressive and overtly ideological. To some on the right, she was simply a saviour who dragged Britain from the ungovernable abyss represented by the 1970s.<br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>As can only be expected with such a controversial figure, there have been many books written about her legacy and style of politics. Mrs Thatcher not only made history by becoming Britain’s first female prime minister, she was the first woman to hold any comparable position in the western world. It was this novelty, as much as anything, that caused the Soviets to call her the “Iron Lady” in 1976.<br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>From the start of her leadership of the Conservative party in February 1975, Thatcher’s style seemed shrill and uncompromising, and she became an easy object of mockery. When she left office nearly 16 years later, she was a widely recognised, but clearly still highly controversial, figure. These are some of the books that deal with her life and political achievements:<br></p><h2 id=1-not-for-turning-and-everything-she-wants-by-charles-moore-2013-november-2015>1. <a href=#>Not for Turning</a>, and Everything She Wants by Charles Moore (2013, November 2015)</h2><p class=dcr-epamsi>This two-volume account is the definitive biography which is unlikely to be surpassed any time soon. Well written and objective, this is a comprehensive account of Thatcher’s life and career. As a biography, it is written very much on a Victorian scale but it is human, readable and sensitive.</p><h2 id=2-the-grocers-daughter-and-the-iron-lady-by-john-campbell-2000-2003>2. <a href=#>The Grocer’s Daughter</a> and <a href=#>The Iron Lady</a> by John Campbell (2000, 2003)</h2><p class=dcr-epamsi>Another impressive two-volume account of Thatcher’s life and career. While (former Telegraph editor) Moore is broadly sympathetic, Campbell’s hostility to the philosophy of Thatcherism is all too apparent in these books. Both volumes are worth a read, although Moore’s efforts will probably supersede this earlier biography.</p><figure id=ebb3df3f-11d9-4513-a070-581f1b6400bd data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Alan Hollinghurst wins the Man Booker prize 2004 for The Line of Beauty.</span> Photograph: Ferdaus Shamim/WireImage</figure><h2 id=3-the-line-of-beauty-by-alan-hollinghurst-2004>3. <a href=#>The Line of Beauty</a> by Alan Hollinghurst (2004)</h2><p class=dcr-epamsi>Hollinghurst’s controversial and brilliant novel, which won the Booker prize in 2004, tells the story of a gay affair in the 80s, at the height of Thatcher’s political dominance. The Iron Lady herself is an ever haunting presence in the background of the story, although she is not integral to it.</p><h2 id=4-thatcher-and-sons-by-simon-jenkins-2006>4. <a href=#>Thatcher and Sons</a>, by Simon Jenkins (2006)</h2><p class=dcr-epamsi>A controversial non-fiction account of New Labour, showing how both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were hugely influenced by the example of Thatcher. Jenkins stresses Thatcher’s role in centralising power and her abilities as a manipulator of the media.</p><figure id=4ba33b59-9c00-4955-903b-7baad496398b data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Jonathan Aitken with Margaret Thatcher at Westminster Abbey in 1978, the year before she won power in a general election.</span> Photograph: PA</figure><h2 id=5-margaret-thatcher-power-and-personality-by-jonathan-aitken-2013>5. <a href=#>Margaret Thatcher: Power and Personality</a> by Jonathan Aitken (2013)</h2><p class=dcr-epamsi>Jonathan Aitken was a Conservative MP from 1974 to 1997 and was famously denied promotion because he had made Carol [Thatcher’s daughter] cry. His charming account benefits from first-hand experience of the House of Commons and politics, while having been an ex-boyfriend of the subject’s daughter he writes with a degree of critical detachment.<br></p><h2 id=6-billy-elliot-by-melvin-burgess-2001>6. <a href=#>Billy Elliot</a> by Melvin Burgess (2001)</h2><p class=dcr-epamsi>The novelisation of Lee Hall and Stephen Daldry’s award-winning film, telling the story of a young boy from a mining village who dreams of becoming a ballet dancer. The story is a commentary on Thatcher’s Britain from a decidedly hostile political viewpoint. A brilliant and deservedly successful story that is overtly critical of Margaret Thatcher’s legacy.</p><h2 id=7-the-downing-street-years-by-margaret-thatcher-1993>7. <a href=#>The Downing Street Years</a> by Margaret Thatcher (1993)</h2><p class=dcr-epamsi>A personalised and, in some ways, self-justificatory account of Thatcher’s own premiership. As is to be expected, she is blunt about the challenging people she confronted, and doesn’t leave any room for doubt regarding the decisions that she took as prime minister.</p><figure id=7b44bc9c-43a6-4679-8c12-22964b4125b1 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev with Margaret Thatcher in 1989, with defence minister Alan Clark in the background.</span> Photograph: Rex</figure><h2 id=8-diaries-by-alan-clark-1993-2000-2002>8. <a href=#>Diaries</a> by Alan Clark (1993, 2000, 2002)</h2><p class=dcr-epamsi>In Power, 1983-1992, the first of Clark’s three volumes of diaries (though second in chronological sequence), directly corresponds with Thatcher at the height of her authority, and contains one of the best accounts of her political demise. Clark is funny, irreverent, lascivious and ultimately thwarted in his ambition to become a cabinet minister. His diaries are a literary landmark of the period.</p><h2 id=9-not-for-turning-by-robin-harris-2013>9. <a href=#>Not for Turning</a> by Robin Harris (2013)</h2><p class=dcr-epamsi>Harris, a former director of the Conservative Research Unit, is very much a cheerleader and supporter of Thatcher’s political mission. His account of her life is fulsome and proud, giving good insights into her political preoccupations. This is very much an account for supporters, although the writing is accessible for all.</p><figure id=3a6baffb-843c-4b4a-b181-22b65ec1d3cc data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>The coffin of Margaret Thatcher is carried in St Paul’s Cathedral during her ceremonial funeral on 17 April 2013.</span> Photograph: Gareth Fuller/AFP/Getty Images</figure><h2 id=10-the-assassination-of-margaret-thatcher-by-hilary-mantel-2014>10. <a href=#>The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher</a> by Hilary Mantel (2014)</h2><p class=dcr-epamsi>This controversial, and slightly bizarre short story, recently longlisted for the BBC short story awards, marks the intense fascination and hatred Thatcher aroused amongst the political left. Mantel cannot disguise her loathing of everything Thatcher stood for. An interesting, although slightly warped, counterbalance to generally positive more recent biographies and skilful piece of writing.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Kwasi Kwarteng is Conservative MP for Spelthorne, Surrey</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Kwasi Kwarteng’s Thatcher’s Trial: Six months that defined a leader, is available from the Guardian Bookshop for £16 (rrp £20).
