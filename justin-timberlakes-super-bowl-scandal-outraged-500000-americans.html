As Justin finished singing the final lyrics, the Cry Me A River hitmaker wrapped his hand around Janet’s body in a choreographed move. He proceeded to rip off a piece from her PVC bustier, revealing her right breast, which was partly covered by a nipple shield. According to Jackson’s management, Timberlake was supposed to pull the bustier to reveal a red lace bra, but the “garment collapsed”, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as per</a> Grazia.</p><p>The world was shocked, to say the least, and thus the incident was dubbed “Nipplegate”.</p><p>JT was the first to issue a statement, apologizing for the “unintentional and regrettable wardrobe malfunction.” Producer MTV echoed the same message, saying “The tearing of Janet Jackson’s costume was unrehearsed, unplanned, completely unintentional, and was inconsistent with assurances we had about the content of the performance.”</p><p>Stories didn’t match when Janet, 57, described the situation one day later as a “costume reveal”, a decision she made after final rehearsals, shifting blame away from producers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40>Nevertheless, more than 500,000 complaints flooded the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), prompting an investigation into whether the performance violated the FCC’s indecency standards.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-janet-jackson-was-blacklisted-on-radio-stations-after-the-super-bowl-but-justin-timberlake-s-career-continued>Janet Jackson was ‘blacklisted’ on radio stations after the Super Bowl but Justin Timberlake’s career continued</h2><p>CBS was never fined Janet Jackson’s Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction, and Justin Timberlake went on to win two <a href=#>Grammys</a> one week later. Janet Jackson’s career, meanwhile, began to derail. In March 2004, the Rhythm Nation singer released what became one of her lowest-selling albums since 1984, and her music was blacklisted on various stations.</p><p>Fast-forward 17 years later, Timberlake issued his first direct apology to Jackson, following backlash from the Framing Britney documentary.</p><p>“I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem, where I spoke out of turn, or did not speak up for what was right,” he said. “I specifically want to apologize to <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> and Janet Jackson individually, because I care for and respect these women and I know I failed.”</p><p>The Mirrors singer confirmed Nipplegate had been resolved between the two artists, but the infamous moment will go down in Super Bowl history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-2921113-1024x731.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-two-more-shocking-live-tv-moments>Two more shocking live TV moments</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kanye-west-crashes-taylor-swift-s-vma-2009-speech>Kanye West crashes Taylor Swift’s VMA 2009 speech</h3><p>If we forget Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson’s Super Bowl fiasco for one moment, we need to head to the VMAS. In 2009, <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> was a music newbie who had just won her first <a href=#>MTV Video Music Award</a> for You Belong With Me. Midway through her acceptance speech, <a href=#>Kanye West</a> took over her mic to express his disapproval of the win, claiming <a href=#>Beyonce</a> had the “best video of all time” for Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It). Even Queen Bey was left speechless and the crowd began to boo Ye.</p><p>Tay Tay later admitted she began sobbing, thinking the audience agreed with the rapper’s remarks.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-smith-and-chris-rock-slap>Will Smith and Chris Rock slap</h3><p>The slap that was heard around the world.</p><p>Unless you’ve avoided the internet for two years, you probably know about the <a href=#>Oscars</a> slap of 2022. Smith stormed the stage and attacked the comedian after he poked fun at <a href=#>Jada Pinkett Smith</a>‘s bald hairstyle, the result of her alopecia. The award-winning star demanded Chris to “keep my wife’s name out of your mouth.” It was so unexpected that celebrities and fans mistook it for a skit between longtime friends.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2Z%2BcLbUrKuipl2ptq6uxKujmqOVqHq0wc%2BeqWaan6y5br%2FCmqWdmZxivLbA0Zqenpxdan1xfI9pZJqllae2pK3NrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
