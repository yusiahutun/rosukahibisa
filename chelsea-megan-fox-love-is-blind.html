During the 10 days,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the couples can decide if they want to get engaged</a>—still sight unseen.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jimmy-chelsea-back-together-love-is-blind.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/love-is-blind-gold-cups.png><p>When asked if she’d ever been compared to a celebrity, Chelsea—a flight attendant—told Jimmy: “All the time on the plane. I get one person, and it’s just because I have dark hair and blue eyes. But I don’t see it, so don’t get excited.” She hinted: “MGK’s wife or his fiancée,” to which Jimmy asked: “Are you saying you look like Megan Fox?” She added: “It’s just because I have light eyes and dark hair. That’s the only reason. There’s nothing else. At least, I’m assuming so.”</p><p>Fan backlash was pretty swift. “Apart from the fact that it defeats the purpose of the show, if someone picks you because they think you look like the one woman an entire generation of teenage boys lusted for.. kind of sets you up for failure? [sic]” wrote one fan on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>the&nbsp;Love Is Blind&nbsp;subReddit.</a></p><p>“He might have not found her attractive anyway but if you’re expecting Megan fox even Megan fox probably won’t live up to your expectation, [sic]” said another. Another viewer quipped, “If she thinks she looks like Megan Fox then not only love is blind but she is too.” Here’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chelsea’s response to the backlash</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=chelsea-s-megan-fox-lookalike-response>Chelsea’s Megan Fox lookalike response</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chelsea-love-is-blind-1.jpg><p>In response to audiences’ reaction, Chelsea shared a post to Instagram stories and TikTok saying: “This would be a great time for people who’ve ever told me that I resembled her to come forward, please, I’m begging you,” she said, laughing. Prior to that, she shared a post with the caption: “Go on a show to find love > get your ass dragged,” as she posed to the tune of Led Zeppelin’s “Immigrant Song”.</p><p>In a confessional after the big reveal, Jimmy admitted: “She definitely lied to me on some of how she looked. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chelsea told me she looked like Megan Fox</a>. At the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter, I’m very attracted to her, I can work with that.” Apparently, he can, because he popped the question.</p><p>“Chelsea, I love you. I love every bit of every conversation we’ve ever had. I love the way you love me. I love the way you make me feel,” he told her. “I always leave with a smile on my face and more happy than when you found me,” he continued. “I’m so excited to start a life with you and grow a family and build a future together.” He <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>asked her to marry him</a>, and she bent down on her knees, shaking. “I will 1000% marry you,” a thrilled Chelsea said.</p><p>Since the premiere of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Love Is Blind</a>, the show has become one of Netflix’s highest-rated series, with more than 30 million views in its first two months. “Across the world, everybody feels the same way: Everyone wants to be loved for who they are on the inside. It doesn’t matter where you live, what you look like, how old you are, what your background is, which class you know, or social structure you feel like you’re a part of, everyone wants to be loved for who they are,” creator Chris Coelen told&nbsp;Variety&nbsp;in 2020.</p><p>“In today’s society we’ve got all these ways to find love through dating apps and technology. Those things sort of counterintuitively have made people feel disposable. They’ve made people feel like it’s all surface level. It does the opposite thing it was supposed to do. So we thought, what if we took everybody’s devices away, how could we get them to focus on connecting with other people?”</p><p>Coelen also told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>&nbsp;about how the connections on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Love Is Blind</a>&nbsp;were based on choice, which is why the relationships were that much stronger. “It was incredibly scary because nobody had to do anything, versus a show like we do Married at First Sight, you sign up and you know, you’re getting married to a stranger. Here, nobody had to do anything. It was if you find someone, if you choose. Which is so scary. They don’t have to go through with the wedding ceremony,” he said. “But assuming they found someone, could that love overcome any judgment in the real world? That’s an incredibly fascinating question. And that’s what we set out to try to examine.”</p><p>Of 30 contestants, only five couples got engage on&nbsp;Love Is Blind&nbsp;Season 6: AD and Clay; Jimmy and Chelsea; Brittany and Ken; Johnny and Amy; and Jeramey and Laura.
