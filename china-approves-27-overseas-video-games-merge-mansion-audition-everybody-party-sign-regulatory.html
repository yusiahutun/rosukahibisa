It also marks a contrast to the past two years, when there was almost an 18-months gap without any approvals being issued for imported games.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Liao Xuhua, research director focusing on culture and entertainment at Beijing-based Analysys, said the fact that licences were now being issued after only a 3-month gap was “notable”, indicating that “the approval process [of online games] is returning to normal and there will not be long pauses”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This move has further confirmed the previous expectation and consensus that the strict regulation of the gaming industry has come to an end,” Liao said, adding that it will not only “have a significant impact” on gaming companies but more importantly, it helps to “restore confidence” in the industry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nonetheless, statistics from NPPA show that the number of approved foreign games has decreased over the past three years. In 2020, China approved 97 imported games, while the number dropped to 76 in 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/21/4c5b0585-100d-4313-87df-47dddf516da6_f3902699.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Starting in August 2021, approvals of domestic or foreign games stopped as the Chinese government imposed a crackdown on the industry, which included tighter scrutiny of online content and limits on playing time for those under 18 years old.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China resumed granting licences for domestic titles in April last year, and approved 88 and 87 licences for games developed by domestic firms in January and February of this year, respectively. The numbers exceeded the number of licences approved in each batch of approvals for domestic games last year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last year, a total of 468 domestic games were approved, a 38 per cent drop from 2021, and only one third of the total number of licences approved in 2020.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Due to the regulatory and economic headwinds, China’s video game sales slumped by more than 10 per cent to 269.5 billion yuan (US$39.8 billion) last year, marking the first decline in at least two decades, with the number of gamers slipping 0.33 per cent to 664 million, according to a report published last week by the country’s semi-official gaming industry association.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwaavx2inqKSZmMZwrdGtoJyklWSAc32Ta3ByZ5Odtq%2BtjJqnqaqfq7K0eZFwZKiulafApq3SZq2inJWkeqitzJ6qZqWVp7Smecyapayhn6N6osHDoquip55isrex0bKZqJypYr2ivtOyZKyhl6N6s7HGrqOarJ%2Bnxg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
