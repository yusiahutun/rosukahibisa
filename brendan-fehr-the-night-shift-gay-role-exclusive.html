"I think it was the risks involved as well. To play a homosexual on network television, what are the risks? There's a whole bunch of them. What are the rewards? Not as many. I just felt like I had something to offer."</p><p>"I've never defined myself as being straight, what defines me is who I am, what I believe, the choices I make and how I treat people," Brendan adds.. "There are a lot of times where gay and lesbians in TV and movies are defined by their sexuality. [Drew] is a guy who wants to be a doctor, not a 'gay doctor.'"</p><p>Fehr, who was raised as a strict Mennonite, is hardly the first straight actor to play gay -- but might be one of the more candid stars when it comes to discussing his initial discomfort with the role.</p><p>"It was uncomfortable for me," he says "In Episode 106, my boyfriend comes and I don't like kissing guys, it doesn't do anything for me. It's really uncomfortable, but you gotta get past that, his story is bigger than that. The emotion behind that is so much bigger that that. I was scared, petrified in a lot of ways, but I wanted to push myself and see if I could do it."</p><p>Brendan says he now feels "honored" to have had the opportunity to play Drew, and hopes he does the character justice.
