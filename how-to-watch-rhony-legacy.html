See the RHONY Legacy cast below.</p><ul><li>Ramona Singer (Season 1 – 13)</li><li>Luann de Lesseps (Season 1 – 13)</li><li>Kelly Killoren Bensimon (Season 2 – 4)</li><li>Sonja Morgan (Season 3 – 13)</li><li>Dorinda Medley (Season 7 – 13)</li><li>Kristen Taekman (Season 6 – 7)</li></ul><p>In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/these-rhony-legacy-besties-know-theyve-made-iconic-tv>Daily Beast</a> in December 2023, Luann explained why she was “apprehensive” to say yes to starring in RHONY Legacy. “When it was for Legacy, I was probably more apprehensive about that, because there’s so much more to share. You get into what storylines [you had] and life, as opposed to just going on a girls’ trip for a week. I was a lot happier—let’s put it that way—to actually do [this show] instead,” she said.</p><p>She also told the site about whether there will be more RHONY Legacy seasons after The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip Season 4. “I know the fans want to have more series with us. Maybe [it can just be] OGs are just traveling—going on Below Deck, finally getting those Latin lovers in Argentina. I just feel like it was time,” she said. “We’ve had a great run. I moved onto Crappie Lake, I’m very busy with my cabaret career, which is kicking off a new tour in February, by the way. I have children! I’ve been super busy, so a week on vacation with the OGs was just perfection for me.”</p><p>Bensimon also addressed her drama with Taekman during RHONY Legacy. “I can’t speak for her. I can speak to myself. All of the fans know I’m 100-percent authentic. I come into the room and I am who I am and I bring every single thing that came through that door with me—good, bad, or ugly. If I’m in a bad mood, I’m in a bad mood,” she said. “I don’t just turn on for the cameras, because I don’t do that, period. I’ve always been myself and I think that’s one thing the fans really like about me: They can rely on me. I’m not going to Google search [myself], I’m not going to watch every show back and forth [like Kristen says she does in RHONY Legacy], and I’m not going to figure out what people’s storylines are. I know if you’re a good person, believe me. I’ve got a very good radar for humans.”</p><p>The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip: RHONY Legacy is available to stream on <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_stylecaster?q=https%3A%2F%2Fimp.i305175.net%2Fc%2F256585%2F828265%2F11640%3FsubId1%3DSC-%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.peacocktv.com%252F&p=https%3A%2F%2Fstylecaster.com%2Fentertainment%2Ftv-movies%2F1684433%2Fhow-to-watch-rhony-legacy%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.
