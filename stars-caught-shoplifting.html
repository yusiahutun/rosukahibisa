She was captured on camera stealing a $2,500 necklace from a jewelry store in Venice Beach. In the days that followed, she was even spotted wearing the stolen piece of jewelry.</p><p>Ultimately, Lindsay ended up in court where she was <a href=#>sentenced</a> to 480 hours of community service and 120 days in jail, which she served at home due to jail overcrowding.

She was arrested and taken to jail but was later released on $20,000 bail. She was charged with felony grand theft and possession of pharmaceutical drugs without a prescription.</p><p>The following year, she was <a href=#>sentenced</a> to 480 hours of community service and forced to pay more than $10,000 in fines. While she didn’t face any jail time, she was warned that if she stole again, she would be locked up.

When she was taken to court, she was offered some unique punishments.</p><p>"They actually took me into the court, and I had two choices and I took the second choice, which was wrapping [gifts] for Christmas, which was awesome, it wasn't really a punishment. The other one was they were gonna make me wear a sign that said I stole from Walmart and stand outside Walmart for three days," she admitted to <a href=#>Express</a>.</p><a id=gallery-link-b9900675-de5a-5134-87a7-a647d2dd3a2e class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:b9900675-de5a-5134-87a7-a647d2dd3a2e data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:cbfac100-651c-45e8-be24-85ce2ad1fb40 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b7/4by3/2018/03/28/b7db5dbf6df65a8bbd8ba02dea79c7c9_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><strong>4.</strong> <a href=#><strong>Amy Schumer</strong></a></p><p>Amy Schumer admits she was a major shoplifter in her younger years. Between the ages of 14 and 21, she estimates she stole over $100,000 worth of merchandise. While she started off small, she says it became "grand larceny" in college.</p><p>"I just discovered this department store where you could just take whatever and then return it for cash -- no tags, no receipt, nothing," she told <a href=#>GQ</a>. "You know, thousands of dollars. It was exciting. It was the adrenaline -- the actual act of getting away with it. It wasn't about the money, even though the money was nice. And I didn't feel bad about it. It was this huge corporation. You know, I never stole from people. I never stole from a little store."</p><p>Amy officially said goodbye to her shoplifting hobby in her early 20s when she was caught stealing from Bloomingdales and was taken to court.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:604acdb4-8e9b-4767-baa4-23e044fedf14 data-container-ref=toofab:article:cbfac100-651c-45e8-be24-85ce2ad1fb40 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/87/5by4/2023/07/28/8743a78516844845b9f008b3be5e7252_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">These Stars Have All Been Banned From Other Countries</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>5.</strong><a href=#><strong> Kim Richards</strong></a></p><p>“Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Kim Richards was caught stealing from Target in 2015.
