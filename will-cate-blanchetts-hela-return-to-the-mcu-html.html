Is Cate Blanchett's Hela returning to the MCU? How credible are the casting rumors concerning Blanchett and 'Thor: Love and Thunder?'
Published on August 12, 2020   2 min read The two-time Oscar winner and six-time nominee Cate Blanchett portrayed the villainous goddess of death, Hela, in Thor: Ragnarok. She sashayed with a sinister sense of superiority and slew anyone who dared to stand in her way. While it was fun to watch such a talented actor take on a vindictive and heinous supervillain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, her character development fell flat."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Thus, the rumor may have a little bit of clout to it, yet Blanchett has yet to confirm or deny such rumors.

While Marvel may be preventing such an obvious slip-up for the surprise factor, it would be wise not to jump on board with any rumored casting returns until the actor herself, or others involved in the project confirm such.&nbsp;Cate Blanchett also has quite the packed schedule, with four movies currently in pre-production: Armageddon Time, Borderlands, Lucy and Desi, and Don’t Look Up.</p><p id=par-8_65>Though Blanchett deserves a return to the franchise — to give her character (a long-lost sister) a more fleshed-out character arc — that doesn’t mean the studio will fulfill this fan wish. Not to mention, if Thor: Love and Thunder is Hemsworth’s final turn, the writers may choose to keep the focus on him, giving the character and the fans the glorious farewell they deserve.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqrjLZpqarJVir62tzZyfnqykqHqpscuaZKudpKq%2Fr3nTqGStoJViuqTBjaGrpqRf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
