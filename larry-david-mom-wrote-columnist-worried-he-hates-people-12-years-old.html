Long before he and Jerry Seinfeld took their unique schtick of griping about human foibles and behaviors to the national airwaves on Seinfeld -- and later on David's own Curb Your Enthusiasm -- his general attitude was leaving his mother concerned."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

David said she would talk about the column so much when he was younger that he would even read it from time to time.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Larry Davidâ€™s mom wrote a letter to a <a href=#>@nypost</a> psychiatrist about him ðŸ˜‚ <a href=#>#FallonTonight</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/iuoZaqmdyq</a></p>â€” The Tonight Show (@FallonTonight) <a href=#>April 16, 2024</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@FallonTonight</a><p>It was during one such reading that he found something that rang kind of familiar to his young ears. "I recognized that this was my mother writing to the psychiatrist," he said of the letter. "It was my mother, I know it."</p><p>"She's saying that my son, he's 12 years old, he hates people, he's morose, he's taciturn," David told Fallon while laughing about the memory. "And, what really gave it away, he doesn't trick-or-treat."</p><p>It was the last detail that convinced David that the article was about him, because he'd already rejected the whole concept of trick-or-treat by the time he was 12. It's a stance he still stands by, calling the Halloween tradition "stupid."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:951efb22-ec75-4191-83c3-1cdce87fed53 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8069a01d-5eee-4d98-848e-589d87b54775 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ab/5by4/2024/02/08/ab0722be47b24a4b8de46cca10e047eb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Wil Wheaton's Triggered, Angry Response to Larry David Assaulting Elmo Goes Viral, Divides Fans</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"You're dealing with strangers all over the place. Every apartment is a stranger. It's rude to [go] banging on someone's door. It's stupid," David declared. "I didn't want to see all those people. And then the costume?!The costume! You gotta put a costume on? Come on!"</p><p>It's not the first time that David has mentioned his assertion that his mother wrote the letter he purportedly read all those years ago; he briefly mentioned it in passing for a <a href=#><strong>New York Times</strong></a> interview in 2020.</p><p>But the <a href=#><strong>New York Post</strong></a> said they've not been able to find it in their archives, nor have archivists at the Columbia University Libraries, who maintain a physical collection of Franzblau's columns and writings.</p><p>Nevertheless, the anecdote perfectly sums up David's public persona, and suggests that it may have even more roots in his truth than most people have suspected for real. Curb may have been a heightened version of Larry David, but many aspects of it appear to ring true -- and have for at least 64 years.</p><a id=gallery-link-b467f37a-43df-4eaf-b094-c2657d822342 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:b467f37a-43df-4eaf-b094-c2657d822342 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:8069a01d-5eee-4d98-848e-589d87b54775 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/be/4by3/2024/04/15/be5a9fbff25d420591ae8853211014d0_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21mam9foa6zvthmm5qumZl6rrvMZq6rp6SaeqS7y66kp6GjqXq4u9GroJ6cXZ2ybrTArZysZaCavLG4xGZoa2Wpmq6zv4yoo51n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
