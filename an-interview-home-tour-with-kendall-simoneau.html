It became a respite from the world's craziness and a way to unite. We watched a home owner's excitement on reveal day, and it became our own. Even the stories about heartbreaking loss and grief affected us far more deeply than we expected. Especially when we watched the Davis-Jefcoat family become one; Angela Tarrant, the&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Home Town</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;producer, finally getting her dream house after the loss of her mother and the unforgettable story of Kendall Simoneau.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kendall's episode was one of the most-watched episodes in&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Home Town</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;history. If you missed it, she shared how her late husband, Kurt, passed away unexpectedly in an accident only two years after their wedding. She decided to move back to Laurel to heal and be close to a supportive community of friends.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>We've had the joy of knowing Kendall for a few years, as she is a dear friend and employee at Laurel Mercantile Co. We can attest that she's just as genuine and kind in real life, and it's a joy to walk with her through the highs and the lows.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_5_00_03_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Kendall's life has changed and progressed in many ways since her reveal. Today, she's opening her home and heart to share her experience on the show, how she's adjusting to her new home, and how Laurel has become the best place to heal and move forward.&nbsp;</p><h3>EXTERIOR</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_5_02_26_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"Honestly, being on the show was easy because it's Ben and Erin. Having that relationship with them already made our conversations during filming flow smoothly. It didn't feel like I was on a show; it just felt like I was with friends."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_5_00_56_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"One of the reasons I chose this house was for the location. I have several of my Mercantile family on all sides of me. It is not uncommon for them to come over for dinner or to go shopping. It is also great having Brooke down the street from me because she has been so supportive. She is the only person in my life that truly gets what I am going through, and she encourages me to trust in God and His plan for me if even in my dark moments."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_5_01_43_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>ENTRY</h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"This room is my mom's favorite because of the way the light pours in and how you can look out onto the street. She describes it as peaceful and a perfect place to have a morning coffee."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_54_53_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_52_19_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span>"One thing that I love about my home is that a lot of pieces have a story. I remember these tables and chairs vividly from our summer trips to California. They lived in the apartment above Grandma's garage. It was our spot to play cards, which we still do today."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_19_48_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_18_53_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>SITTING&nbsp;ROOM</h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"The green couch is the one piece of furniture from the shows that everyone always raves about. It is beautiful and a stand-out piece. However, it is not Hans-friendly. So I decided to turn the office into my TV room with a large sectional big enough for Hans. His favorite spot is by the window so we can look out and see everyone going by."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_14_36_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"My home is mostly filled with gifts, souvenirs, and things that help me remember, including this rocking chair. It was my mom's first birthday gift from her parents. It's has been passed down for years, and we usually put it in front of the Christmas tree every year."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_16_57_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_14_54_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_15_18_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_16_01_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_15_30_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>DINING ROOM</h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"When I bought this house, the new dining room was originally the living room. I knew from the beginning I wanted to swap it around and make the fireplace the focal point of the dining. I also knew that I wanted the table Kurt and I bought together to live there. It was the first piece of furniture that we bought together as a married couple that we picked up at Peddler's Junktion. It is nothing fancy, just a simple table that someone refurbished that we loved."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_17_52_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_18_02_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_20_59_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>"<span>The dining room also holds my most treasured possessions. Sitting on what was once our dresser, is a basket of letters. Letters from my grandparents and parent over the years. As well as the letters from Kurt that Erin used to make the quilt. The love he put into those letters is something that I will cherish forever."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_28_52_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_29_29_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>KITCHEN</h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"The kitchen is the room I gravitate to most and love to look at, mainly because of the butler's pantry. Everyone who knows me knows that I am not much of a cook, but the butler's pantry was one of the first things that made me fall in love with the house. It's a focal point in that space, and I can't get enough of it."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_41_29_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_41_51_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_45_50_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_43_19_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_42_03_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_42_53_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_45_20_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_46_55_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_46_35_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_47_48_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_5_05_29_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"Kurt and I loved shopping for antiques together. The wooden piece that lives in the kitchen will always be our favorite find. We picked it up the weekend before he passed. We saw it and immediately fell in love.

This piece is special because she incorporated some special things such as the date and location of our wedding, our song, favorite verse on love, and the song I walked down the aisle. It was on the mantle above the altar, and after our wedding, we hung it in our bedroom."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_4_30_52_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_5_07_51_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Aug_18_5_08_05_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>MASTER BEDROOM</h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"I knew Erin was going to do something with Kurt's letters, but the quilt was truly unexpected.
