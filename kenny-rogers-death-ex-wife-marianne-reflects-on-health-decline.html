I don’t know if [his] body was strong enough to take it.”</p><p>The doting mom tells Closer she got word of Kenny’s death when her son, 38, called her with the sad news. “I knew that he was not in great health,” she says, adding that Kenny’s wife <strong>Wanda Miller</strong> called Chris and “wanted to tell him that things were not looking good and the end was near. I think they thought he had a couple more weeks, but he didn’t.”</p><p>Although Marianne and Chris weren’t there to say goodbye when Kenny died, the Georgia native says she believes “Wanda and his twin boys” were by his side. “I think they probably needed nurses with him and probably said maybe it’s a good idea to put him in the hospital, but decided to have him stay at home,” she notes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kenny-rogers-marianne-gordon.jpg><p>Despite going separate ways with the Country Music Hall of Famer almost three decades ago, Marianne is still heartbroken over his unfortunate death. “He was an incredible person,” she gushes to Closer. “It’s very upsetting when I start talking about him … for 17 of 21 years, every day, he was so sweet.”</p><p><b><i>For more on your favorite celebs, pick up the latest issue of Closer Weekly, on newsstands now — and be sure to&nbsp;</i></b><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=s2><b><i>sign up for our newsletter</i></b></span></a><b><i>&nbsp;for more exclusive news!</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46knKemqWK%2FsLPEq6pmnJWWwal5xLFksKGWmnqurdGimKemlWK%2FprLLnpqtq12ku260xJqjraBdmbKkuMinnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
