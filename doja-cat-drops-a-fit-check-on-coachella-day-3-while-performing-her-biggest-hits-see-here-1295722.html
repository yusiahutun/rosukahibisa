On Sunday at the Coachella music festival, Doja Cat transformed into a revolving door as she donned a variety of clothes that wowed the audience during her chaotic performance.</p><p>As reported by <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Doja Cat Drops a Fit Check on Coachella Day 3 While Performing Her Biggest Hits; See Here","1295722","https://www.tmz.com/2024/04/15/doja-cat-coachella-headliner-day-3-wardrobe-changes/","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/doja-cat-drops-a-fit-check-on-coachella-day-3-while-performing-her-biggest-hits-see-here-1295722","TMZ","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","hollywood")'><u>TMZ</u></a>, the rapper took the stage at the 23rd annual event in Indio, California, to cap out weekend one, singing several of her big songs and continually changing her daring costume. Check out these photographs of Doja's numerous outfits throughout her performance. First, she dressed in a baggie white coverall and a flowing blond wig.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><img alt="Doja Cat " title="Doja Cat " width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-04/1713188814_doja-cat-1.jpg></p><p>She then donned tassels of long blond hair extensions that covered the majority of her body, a fur bikini and boots, a yellow leotard with white tights, and finally a white corset with matching underwear. After each costume change, Doja pranced around the platform, gyrating and striking sexual postures, mimicking intercourse with her dancers, and even rolling in dirt at times.</p><p>21 Savage & <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Doja Cat Drops a Fit Check on Coachella Day 3 While Performing Her Biggest Hits; See Here","1295722","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/asap-rocky-rihannas-coachella-date-after-the-formers-surprise-performance-during-tyler-the-creators-set-1295445","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/doja-cat-drops-a-fit-check-on-coachella-day-3-while-performing-her-biggest-hits-see-here-1295722","A$AP Rocky","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","hollywood")'><u>A$AP Rocky</u></a> also made surprise appearances onstage with Doja, assisting her on a few tracks. Meanwhile, Doja's setlist was quite awesome, featuring favorites like Acknowledge Me, Shutcho, Tia Tamera, F*** the Girls, OKLOSER, and Wet V**ina. Doja will return next week for Coachella's second weekend.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=661d310858f33><strong>Doja Cat also performed her new song, MASC</strong></h2><p>Closing up the event as its Sunday night headliner, Doja Cat, the rapper, performed much of her concert while wearing a white fur two-piece ensemble, looking hot in every sense of the term, despite the fact that temperatures were in the high 50s and a stinging wind was blowing over the polo pitch. It doesn't matter. Doja Cat’s performance ended any doubt about whether she was a big enough star to headline Coachella, not by pandering to the audience but by embracing her unique quirkiness. Consider playful wigs, a mud pit, a phony Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton, dancing yetis, and other aspects delivered with complete attention to the role.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite an enormous set and stage appearance, Doja Cat also had a surprise ballad for her fans. Doja released her most recent single, MASC, just 10 days ago, and the ballad about maturity made its live premiere approximately halfway through her performance. Teezo Touchdown, the song's collaborator, appeared onstage to deliver his portion, rapping into a microphone embedded in an arrangement of flowers while wearing white football pads with his distinctive spikes. While his performance was brief, the couple had chemistry, and both of their vocals sounded appropriate for the song.</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Doja Cat Drops a Fit Check on Coachella Day 3 While Performing Her Biggest Hits; See Here",1295722,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/doja-cat-claps-back-at-fan-trying-to-start-feud-with-cardi-b-says-get-a-fkin-life-1292564","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/doja-cat-drops-a-fit-check-on-coachella-day-3-while-performing-her-biggest-hits-see-here-1295722","Content Also read","entertainment","hollywood"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Doja Cat Drops a Fit Check on Coachella Day 3 While Performing Her Biggest Hits; See Here",1295722,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/doja-cat-claps-back-at-fan-trying-to-start-feud-with-cardi-b-says-get-a-fkin-life-1292564","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/doja-cat-drops-a-fit-check-on-coachella-day-3-while-performing-her-biggest-hits-see-here-1295722","Doja Cat Claps Back At Fan Trying To Start Feud With Cardi B; Says ",Get,A,F**kin,Life,&#39;&#39;,"Also_Read","entertainment","hollywood")'><strong>Doja Cat Claps Back At Fan Trying To Start Feud With Cardi B; Says 'Get A F**kin Life'</strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX528rbjYsKaonF%2BZvKutjJyYrWWUp7yxv4yaZJ%2BhpGKwqbHCpGSopl2YvKKvx56jpZldma66eZJmrqGhnJp6sbHRn6arpZmjtG60xKtkm6GXnLK0wIyhoK2rXaiypnnHnqmeZWFnhnaDkWs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
