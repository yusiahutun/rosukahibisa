But the internet’s been buzzing about a tweak that can give your health an extra boost along with that caffeine hit. It’s affectionately called “proffee” — protein coffee that combines the energy-boosting effects of caffeine with the muscle-building power of protein. Read on to find out how protein coffee can help women over 50 lose weight and more, plus get recipes that make it easy to benefit:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is protein coffee?</h2><p>Protein coffee, or&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">proffee</a>, is exactly what it sounds like — a cup of your favorite brew spiked with a little extra protein. While the most standard version of proffee is made with a plain cup of coffee and a scoop of protein powder, you can add spices,&nbsp;<a href=#>sugar-free syrups</a>&nbsp;and other healthy flavorings — the possibilities are endless.&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Proffee’s combination of energizing coffee with waist-whittling protein is making it especially popular among people looking to lose weight. Research shows that individually, the two ingredients can help&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">make you feel fuller</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">boost calorie burn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">enhance gut health</a>. And when mixed together to make proffee, “this drink stimulates fast and lasting fat loss,” says&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">10-Day Belly Slimdown</a>&nbsp;author&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kellyann Petrucci, MS, ND</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How protein coffee helps weight loss</h2><p>When it comes to slimming down, “proffee makes it easier for your body to burn fat,” explains University of Maryland nutrition expert&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pamela Peeke, MD</a>. One reason: Both coffee and protein have a thermic effect, “which means they create heat as they digest, burning extra calories,” says Dr. Peeke. Plus, it takes more energy for your body to burn and digest protein than it does carbohydrates and fat, which can&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">increase calorie burning</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there’s the caffeine in coffee, which not only gives us a boost of energy but can also help energize metabolism too. Studies show that caffeine triggers&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lipolysis</a>, the breakdown of stored fat in tissue so the body is better able to burn it as fuel.&nbsp;</p><p>And when hunger strikes, proffee can help. That’s because protein helps to increase levels of the hormone&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ghrelin</a>, which researchers reporting in the&nbsp;Journal of Nutrition&nbsp;say&nbsp;helped women feel <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">less hungry</a>&nbsp;than those who ate a high-fat snack. What’s more, protein is known to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">increase levels of hormones</a>&nbsp;like&nbsp;glucagon-like peptide-1&nbsp;(GLP-1),&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the same hormones activated by popular weight loss drug Ozempic</a>.&nbsp;(Click through to see how <a href=#>you can eat overnight oats</a> or <a href=#>add olive oil to your coffee</a> to help fight hunger pangs!)</p><p>Indeed, when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Perrine</a>, as the special projects editor overseeing health and wellness for AARP publications, decided to poll the 38 million members of AARP about the challenges of losing weight over 50, he discovered something very interesting: “The average American eats about the right amount of protein every day, she just eats it at the wrong time — all during the second half of the day,” he says.</p><p>After poring over studies and talking to researchers, Perrine found the biggest predictor of weight loss over 50 was how much protein the person ate before lunch. Increase it to 25+ grams for breakfast and 7+ grams for a morning snack and the pounds just fall off.

Simply combine ¼ cup&nbsp;<a href=#>low-sugar protein powder</a>&nbsp;to 1 cup of hot coffee. For more flavor, add spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, cocoa powder or other healthy add-ins.&nbsp;You can also spoon on some <a href=#>cold foam</a>, a creamy topping that’s made in 90 seconds with milk and mason jar.

Their study of over 26,000 women found that increasing protein intake can help reduce fracture risk by up to 45%, while any type of coffee or tea reduced risk a further 4%. The researchers say that protein builds bone-protecting muscle and tissue, while plant compounds in coffee and tea reduce bone-deteriorating oxidative stress.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How protein prevents sarcopenia</strong></h3><p>Protein is essential for warding off&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sarcopenia</a>, a condition characterized by loss of muscle with age. After age 30, our&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">muscle mass drops by 3-8% each decade</a>, according to the National Institutes of Health, leaving us susceptible to the condition. But research shows that having an adequate protein intake — eating 1 gram of protein per 2 pounds of body weight — can&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dramatically lower risk of sarcopenia</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How protein lowers blood pressure</strong></h3><p>While a daily scoop of protein powder or a shake can help increase how much protein you consume, researchers in the journal&nbsp;Hypertension&nbsp;suggest varying the sources to ward off high blood pressure. They found that people who ate protein from at least four sources, like fish, chicken, steak and protein powder,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">were 66% less likely to develop high blood pressure</a>&nbsp;than those who got protein from fewer than two sources. Switching up your protein sources ensures that your body is provided with a variety of nutrients that nourish the heart and lower blood pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>For more on proffee, click through to our sister publication’s story <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Proffee: The Delicious Breakfast Helping Women Over 60 Lose Weight Effortlessly</a></p><p>For more on how skinny syrups are helping women lose weight, click through to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adding the New Flavored ‘Skinny Syrups’ to Water Is Helping Women Lose 200+ lbs — Discover How It Can Work For You</a></p><p>This content is not a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.
