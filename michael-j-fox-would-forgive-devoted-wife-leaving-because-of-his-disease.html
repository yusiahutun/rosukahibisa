She had indicated to me by saying in for better or for worse, in sickness and in health.”</p><p>“She was able to get me through it and go through it with me. And she has for 35 years.”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> met on the set of Family Ties, portraying each other’s on-screen love interest. They married on July 16, 1988, in Arlington, Vermont. Fox credits giving each other space as the key to their successful marriage.</p><p>“It’s been great for me, I don’t know how it is for her,” he said. “I love Tracy obviously and she’s an amazing person and has gone through a lot.”</p><p>Fox added: “I realize she has a life separate from me having Parkinson’s, from me being Alex Keaton or Marty McFly, she’s a person. I think that’s why it’s gone okay.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-51247037-695x1024.jpg><p>Parkinson’s Disease&nbsp;is a brain disorder that causes uncontrollable movements, such as shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. Symptoms become progressively worse, and it is caused by a loss of nerve cells in a critical region of the brain&nbsp;called the substantia nigra.</p><p>The exact cause of loss of nerve cells is unknown, but it is believed to be related to environmental factors and genetic changes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-michael-j-fox-shares-four-kids-with-his-wife>Michael J Fox shares four kids with his wife</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1442857062-1024x746.jpg><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22>Fox and Pollan welcomed their first child, Sam Michael Fox, on May 30, 1989.
