His Bing Crosby impression in particular shows he’s capable of disappearing into a different character, and his curmudgeonly persona is also on display here, albeit in its embryonic form. David’s comic sensibilities aren’t quite as evolved on Fridays as they are by the end of the 80s with Seinfeld, but the show did provide him the chance to work with two collaborators who would become a big part of his career later on: writer Larry Charles, who served as a writer/producer on Seinfeld and a producer/director on Curb Your Enthusiasm, and Michael Richards, who went on to play the best-known character Larry David ever created.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66c10i9c8e842hdco89l@published data-word-count=78>Fridays was Larry David’s first big chance to work out his comedy on the national stage, and he offers up some of Fridays’ most memorable sketches and collaborates nicely with the whole rest of the cast. Unlike the next job he took for network TV, a writing gig on SNL, David was able to be a major contributor to&nbsp;Fridays’ comic output, whereas on SNL, he only got one sketch on the air the entire season he was there.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66c10i9d8e84odwudwac@published data-word-count=41>For your viewing pleasure, here’s a collection of sketches that Larry David performed in on Fridays. David was only 32 when the show began, and looking back at his earliest TV work provides a neat window into how he got started.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66c10i9e8e84maubbc41@published data-word-count=2><strong>“Howdy Doody”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66c10i9f8e84waou5s3r@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66c10i9h8e84qlzpl2er@published data-word-count=65>Perhaps Larry David’s best-known Fridays sketch, this one features David as a plastic surgeon who is asked by a patient to make him look more like Howdy Doody. It launched a running joke on Fridays about Howdy Doody being a big star and is an early example of David playing around with and repeating an odd voice and phrase, something he still does on Curb.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66c10i9i8e84u7mpjaba@published data-word-count=5><strong>“The Road to El Salvador”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66c10i9j8e848wb29k9x@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66c10i9l8e84spn7tbfk@published data-word-count=72>Larry David plays Bing Crosby to castmember John Roarke’s Bob Hope in this parody of the duo’s Road to… movies that was critical of President Reagan’s policy in Central America. Fridays was known for its outspoken political humor, and this pop culture send-up was a clever way of sneaking a political message into the show. Look for Larry David’s fellow Fridays castmember Michael Richards as an El Salvadoran military officer at 2:21.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66c10i9m8e849k1qkztx@published data-word-count=2><strong>“Temp Feminist”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66c10i9n8e84e9tad9em@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66c10i9o8e84l9r1kj8h@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66c10i9p8e84jnm7v91k@published data-word-count=29>The video quality on this one’s pretty shoddy, but it’s another “Temp” sketch.
