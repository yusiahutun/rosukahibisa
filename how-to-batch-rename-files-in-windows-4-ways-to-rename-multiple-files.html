Windows provides more ways to do this than you may realize.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can easily rename one or more files just with Windows Explorer, but you can do even more with the Command Prompt or PowerShell. Add in third-party renaming utilities, and the possibilities are endless. Let's take a look at each option and how it works.</p><p>Microsoft now has <a href=#>a free PowerRename batch-renaming utility</a> that works well for renaming multiple files. You can install it on Windows 10 or Windows 11.</p><h2 id=rename-multiple-files-in-windows-explorer>Rename Multiple Files in&nbsp;Windows Explorer</h2><p>Windows Explorer (known as File Explorer in Windows 10) is surprisingly powerful. You probably know how to rename a single file, but let's start with the basics, since the advanced tricks build off them.</p><p>If you're using your mouse, you have no less than three ways to select a file's name and rename it. You can:</p><ul><li>Click to select the file and then click the "Rename" button on the Home menu.</li><li>Click to select file and then click the name of the selected file.</li><li>Right-click the file and then select "Rename" on the context menu.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png><p>And if you prefer sticking with your keyboard, you can just use your arrow keys (or start typing the file name) to select a file and then hit F2 to select the file name.</p><p>Once you've got the file name selected---and you'll notice only the file name itself is selected, not the extension---you can type a new file name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_9.png><p>When you're done typing the file name, you can press Enter (or just click somewhere else) to save the new name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here's where things get interesting: you can also hit the Tab key to&nbsp;automatically select the next file name in the folder so that you can immediately begin typing a new name for it. Keep hitting Tab and typing names this way and you can easily rename all the files in a folder if you're so inclined.</p><p>If you're renaming a bunch of files in the same folder and those files don't need completely different names from one another, Windows&nbsp;provides an easier way to rename those files in batch. Start by selecting a bunch of files---you can hold down the Ctrl key to select multiple files at once, or Shift to select a range of files. When you've got the files selected, use one of the rename commands---the button on the Home menu, the command on the context menu, or just press F2. You'll see that all the files remain selected, but the first one in the group gets its name highlighted so you can type a new name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png><p>Type a new name for the file and then hit Enter or click somewhere else in the window. All the selected files are renamed using the name you just typed, and are appended with a number in parentheses to differentiate them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png><h2 id=rename-multiple-files-from-the-command-prompt>Rename Multiple Files from&nbsp;the Command Prompt</h2><p>If you need more power than that, you can&nbsp;use the</p><pre><code class="hljs sql"><span class=hljs-keyword>rename</span></code> </pre><p>&nbsp;or <code>ren</code>&nbsp;command in a Command Prompt window to one or more files. The command accepts wildcard characters like * and ? for matching multiple files, which can be helpful if you only want to rename a certain selection of files in a folder full of many.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The quickest way to open a Command Prompt window at your desired location is to first open the folder in File Explorer. From the "File" menu, point to "Open command prompt," and then select "Open command prompt."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png><p>To rename a single file, you can use the following command syntax:</p><pre>ren "current_filename.ext" "new_filename.ext"</pre><p>The quotes are important if your file names contain any spaces. If they don't, you won't need the quotes. So, for example, to rename a file from "wordfile (1).docx" to "my word file (01).docx" you would use the following command:</p><pre>ren&nbsp; "wordfile (1).docx" "my word file (01).docx"</pre><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png><p>Since the <code>ren</code> command can address extensions, you can also use it to change the extensions of multiple files at once. Say, for example, you had a selection of .txt files that you wanted to turn into .html files. You could use the following command along with the * wildcard (which basically tells Windows that text of any length should be considered a match):</p><pre>ren *.txt *.html</pre><p>And while we're on the subject of wildcards, you can also do some interesting things with the ? wildcard, which is used to stand in for any single character. Say, for example, you had a bunch of .html files that you wanted to turn into .htm files instead. You could use the following command to make the change:</p><pre>ren *.html *.???</pre><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This tells Windows to rename all files with the .html extension to use the same file name and same first three letters only of the file extension, which ends up cutting the "l" off of all the extensions in the folder.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Write a Batch Script on Windows</a></span></p><p>And this only begins to address the kinds of command line wizardy you can get into if you want to build more complicated commands---or even <a href=#>batch scripts</a>---by weaving other commands and conditionals into things. If you're interested, the folks over at the Lagmonster forums have <a href=#>an excellent writeup</a> on the subject.</p><h2 id=rename-multiple-files-with-powershell>Rename Multiple Files with&nbsp;PowerShell</h2><p>PowerShell offers even more flexibility for renaming files in a command-line environment. Using PowerShell, you can pipe the output of one command---known as a "commandlet" in PowerShell terms---to another command, just like you can on Linux and other UNIX-like systems.&nbsp;The two important commands you'll need are <code>Dir</code>, which lists the files in the current directory, and <code>Rename-Item</code>, which renames an item (a file, in this case). Pipe the output of Dir to Rename-Item and you're in business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The quickest way to open a PowerShell&nbsp;window at your desired location is to first open the folder in File Explorer. From the "File" menu, point to "Open Windows PowerShell," and then select "Open Windows Powershell."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png><p>First, let's&nbsp;look at renaming a single file. For that, you would use the following syntax:</p><pre>rename-item &nbsp;"current_filename.ext" "new_filename.ext"</pre><p>So, for example, to rename a file from "wordfile.docx" to "My Word File.docx" you would use the following commandlet:</p><pre>rename-item "wordfile.docx" "My Word File.docx"</pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Easy enough. But the real power in PowerShell comes from the ability to pipe commandlets together and some of the conditional switches supported by the <code>rename-item</code> commandlet. Say, for example, we had a bunch of files named "wordfile (1).docx", "wordfile (2).docx", and so on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png><p>Say we wanted to replace the space in those file names with an underscore so that the file names contain no spaces. We could use the following commandlet:</p><pre>dir | rename-item -NewName {$_.name -replace " ","_"}</pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <code>dir</code> part of that commandlet lists all the files in the folder and pipes them (that's the <code>|</code> symbol) to the <code>rename-item</code> commandlet. The <code>$_.name</code>&nbsp;part stands in for each of the files getting piped. The <code>-replace</code> switch indicates that a replacement is going to happen. The rest of the commandlet just signifies that any space ( <code>" "</code> ) should be replaced by an underscore ( <code>"_"</code> ).</p><p>And now, our files look the way we want.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Geek School: Learn How to Automate Windows with PowerShell</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you might expect, PowerShell offers tremendous power when it comes to naming your files and we're only scratching the surface here. For example, the <code>rename-item</code> commandlet also offers features like a <code>-recurse</code> switch that can apply the commandlet to files in a folder and all folders nested inside that folder, a <code>-force</code> switch that can force renaming for files that are locked or otherwise unavailable, and even a <code>-whatif</code> switch that describes what would happen if the commandlet was executed (without actually executing it). And, of course, you can also build more complicated commandlet structures that even include <code>IF/THEN</code> logic. You can learn more about PowerShell in general from our <a href=#>Geek School guide</a>,&nbsp;and learn more about the <code>rename-item</code> commandlet from <a href=#>Microsoft's TechNet Library</a>.</p><h2 id=rename-multiple-files-using-a-third-party-app>Rename Multiple Files Using a Third Party App</h2><p>If you need a powerful way to rename multiple files at once and you're just not up for mastering the Command Prompt or PowerShell commands, you can always turn to a third-party utility.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Easily Batch Rename Files on Windows 10</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are countless renaming apps out there---and many of them are good---but we have two clear favorites: Bulk Rename Utility and AdvancedRenamer. (<strong>Update</strong>: Be sure to try <a href=#>Microsoft's free PowerRename tool</a>, which works very well and has a user-friendly interface.)</p><h3 id=how-to-use-bulk-rename-utility>How to Use&nbsp;Bulk Rename Utility</h3><p><a href=#>Bulk Rename Utility</a>&nbsp;has a cluttered and somewhat intimidating interface, but it exposes the huge number of options you'd normally only get with regular expressions and complicated command-line options.</p><p>After installing the tool, launch it, navigate to the files you want to rename, and select them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Change options in one or more of the many available panels, and you'll see a preview of your changes appear in the "New Name" column where your files are listed. In this example, I've made changes to four panels, which are now highlighted in orange so it's easier to tell what I've changed. I've told the utility to change the name of all files to "Word File" and to use title case. I've appended the date the file was created in the YMD format. And I've also added an automatic file number that appears at the end of the file name, starts at one, increments by one, and is separated from the file name by an underscore. And that's only a tiny bit of what you can do with the Bulk Rename Utility. When you're satisfied with how your new file names will look, all you have to do is click the "Rename" button.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And as you can see, the utility handled my simple requests with ease.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png><h3 id=how-to-use-advancedrenamer>How to Use&nbsp;AdvancedRenamer</h3><p>Our&nbsp;other favorite renaming tool, <a href=#>AdvancedRenamer</a>, also exposes a huge number of renaming methods, but instead of presenting them all as panels in the interface, it asks that you use a pretty simple but powerful syntax to create renaming methods. It's not hard to learn and they have good support, along with examples. The tool does sport a much friendlier interface and supports setting up advanced batch jobs so you can combine multiple renaming methods and apply them to large numbers of files. You can also save renaming methods you create for later use.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the example below, I've created a renaming method using the following syntax:</p><pre>Word File_&lt;Year&gt;_&lt;Month&gt;_&lt;Day&gt;_(&lt;Inc Nr:1&gt;)</pre><p>This tells AdvancedRenamer to name all my files "Word File" and to add the creation date in the YMD format (separating each portion by an underscore). It also adds an incremental file number in parentheses and separated by an additional underscore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png><p>And as you can see, my files have been renamed just the way I want. AdvancedRenamer has a bit steeper learning curve than Bulk File Renamer, but the reward for that is that you get much finer control over your file names.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wrn_1.png><p>Have other ways to rename files in Windows we haven't covered?
