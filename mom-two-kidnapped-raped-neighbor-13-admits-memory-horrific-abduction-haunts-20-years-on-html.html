After that, I didn't resist anymore.'&nbsp;</span></p>&nbsp;The one time I resisted, he stabbed me in the stomach with the tip of a knife<p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In the essay, Jessyca questioned whether Steven recognized her vulnerability because she was molested by the father of her dad's girlfriend when she was five and then again by her father's roommate who forced her to 'give him oral sex repeatedly'.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Jessyca thought her horror was finally over when her mother and stepfather moved to another town, however, Steven began showing up and asking her and her brothers to come over to play with his son - to the point that her mom even called the police.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Steven eventually moved into a trailer near her father's house in Eau Claire, where she visited every other weekend. In order to continue his abuse, Steven convinced Jessyca's father that join his children's publishing group, and using that has a ruse he later told her dad that he needed to take her to Madison, Wisconsin, to oversee a book of her work, claiming that Random House wanted to publish her writing.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>When Jessyca fell asleep he tied her up, and after she woke up, he told her that from now on she was Cindy Johnson and he was her father David.

After switching hotels a couple of times, they started staying at a Days Inn by the airport, where she stayed locked in the room for more than three months.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Jessyca's kidnapper dyed her blond hair brown and got a job as a maintenance man at the Days Inn. When he was away, she would try calling home until she realized that he had altered the phone so it would dial a number other than the one she was pressing. All of her attempts to reach her family resulted in wrong numbers.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p>&nbsp;One hundred and five days after Oliver kidnapped me, I was back with my family<p class=mol-para-with-font><span>If she disobeyed or angered Steven in any way he would tie her to the bed or beat her. By the time a rerun of America's Most Wanted led to a tip that helped the FBI located them, Jessyca believed her name was Cindy Johnson and had trouble remembering her mother and stepfather until she was shown their pictures.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'As soon as my mom got off the plane, I didn't need anyone's prompting,' she told Cosmopolitan.

She also reported her other abusers and they were convicted as well.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She graduated from the University of Wisconsin at Stout with honors after majoring in psychology and minoring in criminal justice and sociology.

She has struggled with people's questions about why she didn't try harder to get away from Steven.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'It's a question that's haunted me ever since. Everyone says, "I would have done this or that," but they weren't there. Could I have gotten away? No. I'd just turned 13, I weighed 100 pounds, and Oliver had previously stabbed me to keep me quiet. I figured if he had it in him to do that, he could kill me.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Jessyca often fears for her own children's safety and last month she and her mother feared that someone had taken her five-year-old daughter when she never got off the bus after school. The frightened mom was reduced to tears after the bus driver told her that her little girl had never gotten on board the bus.&nbsp;</span></p>&nbsp;Everyone says, "I would have done this or that," but they weren't there<p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Thankfully, Jessyca's daughter was still at school for a Halloween event, but Monica told Wausau Daily Herald that the experience was 'like you got kicked in the stomach'.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Jessyca told the outlet that if someone plans on abducting her children they will most likely do so within the period of her own kidnapping. This September, on the 20th anniversary of her own kidnapping, Jessyca spent the day with her daughter.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She also posted a message on her <a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Facebook</a> page, writing: 'Today marks the 20th year anniversary of my kidnapping.
