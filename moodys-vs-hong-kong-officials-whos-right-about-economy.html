Submissions should not exceed 400 words, and must include your full name and address, plus a phone number for verification.The economic narrative of Hong Kong unfolds in a dialectic between caution and confidence: Moody’s articulates a restrained view, while the Hong Kong government offers a more optimistic projection (“Hong Kong No 2 official slams Moody’s ‘smearing’ credit outlook downgrade”, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">December 7</span></a>).<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whichever perspective one leans towards, it is widely recognised that understanding economic trends is complex – and even the most astute economists can misjudge, as history reminds us with Irving Fisher’s ill-timed assertion of a “permanently high plateau” for the stock market, made just days before the market crash of 1929.</p>Experts have developed numerous metrics aimed at distilling the complexities of economic performance into quantifiable terms. For the lay observer, straightforward metrics such as the unemployment rate are a starting point, yet Hong Kong’s enviable <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">low rate</span></a> does not fully disclose deeper issues such as <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">labour shortages</span></a> and the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">“lying flat” social trend</span></a>, where individuals opt out of the competitive workforce.Moreover, fluctuations in the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hang Seng Index</span></a>, which remains notably adrift from its peak in January 2018, signal investor sentiment but do not always mirror the state of local businesses.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Observations from high street also warrant a judicious appraisal. An increase in vacant shopfronts in Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui could be interpreted as a sign of immediate economic malaise, yet it may also be attributable to the inherently sluggish nature of rental adjustments, which often lag behind the economic cycle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Navigating the macroeconomic climate becomes even more complex when considering the varied fortunes of different sectors. The retail sector struggles amid changing consumer behaviours and a downturn in tourism, while research and technology thrive, buoyed by government incentives. These contrasting sectoral narratives weave a complex economic tapestry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the economic realities in Hong Kong are multifaceted, the narratives – regardless of their precision – have the power to shape economic outcomes. Nobel laureate Robert J. Shiller, in Narrative Economics, emphasises that when a particular economic narrative gains traction, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Even simple economic stories can profoundly affect collective behaviour and influence individuals’ spending, saving and investing decisions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For policymakers in Hong Kong, the challenge goes further than simply interpreting economic data; it entails formulating a narrative that engages the general public. If the populace adopts the government’s optimistic stance, it could enhance consumer confidence and spur increased expenditure and investment, thus potentially invigorating economic growth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rob Yau, Kennedy Town</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">China should put RCEP before the belt and road</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">US-China relations bring to mind the Chinese fable of the tussle between the clam and the snipe. If both do not let go, they will perish. Similarly, a decoupling of the world’s two biggest economies will create repercussions for the world, including themselves.</p>China implemented economic and other policies, including the Belt and Road Initiative, attempting to replace the United States as the global leader. This year, China is celebrating the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">10th anniversary</span></a> of the belt and road programme, but it seems that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">funding is running low</span></a> and the programme is slowing.Meanwhile, the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership</span></a> (RCEP) is intended to improve free trade within the region and steady supply chains. It will foster economic cooperation, reduce conflict and boost common prosperity.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I believe the Belt and Road Initiative should be shelved for the time being, until China has enough funding to satisfy the appetites of developing counties in the queue. The cart of the belt and road should be put behind the horse, while RCEP is the locomotive that will bring wealth to all the nations in the partnership.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lo Wai Kong, Tsuen Wan</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">To improve taxis, start with its lost-and-found system</h3>We refer to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the letter</span></a>, “Revamp taxi operation, rather than crack down on Uber” (December 11) and agree with your correspondents that the taxi industry must update its services to compete with ride-hailing services. A good place to start is its lost-and-found mechanism.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To help passengers who inadvertently leave their belongings in taxis, Commercial Radio operates a lost-and-found hotline and online platform that broadcasts information about lost items, in the hope that taxi drivers who hear the message will return them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, drivers who find an item left in a public transport should take the item to a police station within six hours, unless its owner has claimed it. However, there does not seem to be data on the type of items recovered or the number of items returned with the police’s help.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Transport Department should work with the police to collect such data to assess the current system’s effectiveness.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Given the user-friendly feature of the Uber app for retrieving lost items, we urge the government to emulate Uber’s approach and develop a similar platform that facilitates contact information exchange between passengers and drivers, while taking the necessary measures to safeguard privacy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Moreover, promoting public vigilance during travel and encouraging e-payment would help to expedite driver identification.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We believe these enhancements will help the taxi drivers stay competitive against their Uber counterparts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Man Chak Hei, Ku Tak Chun and Wong Siu Chung, Kowloon Tong</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWecmsG1sdGsZpqqpJ6wrbGObGltbWFnhnC5zqibsqtdq8ButM6nnmajn6O0brvFn6CcoZGhwG7Dx6iqZqqZnLW1ecCbpq6sXZqwsLrOprA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
