"I agree with that," adds Foster, whose role as Danvers is her first on TV since 1975. "For me, streaming is the golden age. That’s where the best narrative is now, and for the most part, theatrical distributors have abandoned making real stories – they’re really in the superhero business. I wanted to get out there and find something and when I did, I knew immediately."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Foster is, of course, an industry veteran; after shooting to fame as Iris in Taxi Driver in 1976, she went on to appear in The Accused and The Silence of the Lambs and has two Oscars, three BAFTAs and three Golden Globes to her name. Reis, however, is something of a new face: True Detective is only the third-ever acting role for the professional boxer. Has her sporting career given her a head start?</p><img alt="1976 american actors jodie foster, center, and robert de niro walk past a parked taxi on a new york city street in a still from the film, 'taxi driver' directed by martin scorsese photo by columbia tristargetty images" title="De Niro And Foster" width=5067 height=3408 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-3438564-65f03a4ba5fc7.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Columbia TriStar</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Jodie Foster (centre) opposite Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver</p><img alt="manchester, nh november 19 kali reis reacts after defeating jessica camara during the wba women’s junior welterweight title and vacant wbo title bout at snhu arena on november 19, 2021 in manchester, new hampshire photo by billie weissgetty images local caption kali reis" title="Demetrius Andrade v Jason Quigley" width=3960 height=2640 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1354789550-65f03ab670e7d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Billie Weiss</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Kali Reis in the ring in 2021</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I feel like I've been training for acting while I've been boxing," she explains. "It's way out of my territory, but I can navigate it pretty easily. With boxing, you can't hesitate, you have to commit. You have to be completely grounded in your character, too – you have to think like them, speak like them. That’s not something I was taught, it’s just something that works for me: that ability to check all the way in, and all the way out."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Foster agrees that the "dropping in" is a key element to acting well. "I always wonder what my life would have been like if I'd been to acting classes," she says. "But I think that’s what training is about – giving you the tools to drop in, whether you need music, or humming, or a cup of coffee."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"The show is funny, it's spooky – it checks all the boxes"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She certainly needed to practise that art as Liz Danvers, the character she has referred to as an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/jodie-foster-true-detective-character-alaska-karen-8424506 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"Alaska Karen"' class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">"Alaska Karen"</a>, especially in the harsh climes of Iceland, where much of the series was filmed. "The most challenging thing was definitely the weather – it was cold," she says. "I had a moment where I was supposed to fall through the ice, so they built a tank and I worked with a free diver to learn how to hold my breath for long enough to sink into the water. The problem was, I wear contact lenses, but I didn’t want to wear them in the water, so I couldn’t see. That was panicky! The first take was really bad – I was like, "Am I gonna die?"'</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There were, though, far more highs than lows for the pair. "We had heated socks, heated vests..." laughs Reis. "Though I didn't try the heated underpants." For Foster, the best on set memory was "being in the middle of shooting and looking up, and there are the Northern Lights. You're surrounded by your friends, seeing this miracle, magical moment that's only going to last ten minutes."</p><img alt="a man sitting at a table" title="True Detective: Night Country" width=8640 height=5760 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/06-01-truedetectivenightcountry-65f03adaa05a3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">HBO</span><p>Foster has had a long and distinguished acting career; this is her first TV role since 1975</p><img alt="a person standing in a room" title="True Detective: Night Country" width=4240 height=2832 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/06-29-truedetectivenightcountry-65f03b05ab96a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">HBO</span><p>For Reis, boxing has informed the way she acts: both require immense discipline</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's clear that Foster and Reis have an easy, relaxed relationship with one another, perhaps born from the sometimes-fractious, sometimes-hilarious interactions between their two characters. "I laughed a lot at Danvers, and at Danvers' relationship with Navarro," says Foster. "I'm not even sure [those jokes] were on the page – I think they just happened in the moment." Reis agrees: "Oh for sure, it wasn't planned."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pair certainly make the job sound easy, but on screen, their chemistry translates to binge-watchable viewing. It all starts, they say, with collaboration. "That way, you start asking the right questions," says Foster. "That's how you deepen the process."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSwtrjTrqmeZZ6axLR7wG9nam9jZYFye8mom6KdXZu8tMDEq2SkmZyeerOxyKxkqKaVYryvec6nnGaumZmysHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
