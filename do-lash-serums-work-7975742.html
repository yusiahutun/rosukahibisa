The good news is: Yes, lash serums can work—but it's not always simple, straightforward, or guaranteed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The effectiveness of lash serums can vary from person to person and from brand to brand," says board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Bertha Baum, DO</a>. "Some people may experience noticeable lash length and thickness improvements after using them consistently. In contrast, others may see little or no results. It's essential to manage expectations, as results may take several weeks to months to become apparent."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Learn what makes a lash serum good, how prescription offers differ from over-the-counter options, and more, below.<br></p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-makes-lash-serums-effective></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Makes Lash Serums Effective</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Getty Images.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Lash serums are eyelash treatments that promise healthier, fuller lashes by using a variety of ingredients to nourish and boost lash thickness and growth," says board-certified ophthalmologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Diane Hilal-Campo, MD</a>. "They are generally applied along the upper lash line or through the length of the lashes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Hiilal-Campo, who is also the founder of eye-friendly beauty brand <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>twenty/twenty beauty</a> explains that these serums include ingredients that strengthen, moisturize, and nourish the lashes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As she puts it, "Helpful ingredients include <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>castor oil</a>, which hydrates the lashes and increases the blood flow to the lash bases, taking them from resting to growth phase; argan oil, which is rich in linoleic acid that coats, moisturizes and thickens lashes; peptides, which are believed to stimulate hair growth at the follicles; keratin, which is a natural protein found in hair that strengthens it; sodium hyaluronate, which acts as a humectant locking in moisture; and biotin, panthenol, and other vitamins that supplement hair growth."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-prescription-lash-serums-vs-over-the-counter-options></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Prescription Lash Serums vs. Over-the-Counter Options</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Prescription lash serums, such as Latisse, differ from over-the-counter (OTC) options because they contain active pharmaceutical-grade ingredients," says Dr. Baum. "Latisse, for example, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has been shown to increase lash length and thickness effectively. However, they may also have a higher risk of side effects, such as red or irritated eyes, which I highly recommend discussing with your dermatologist."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Baum also notes that in rare cases, Latisse (generic name bimatoprost) has been linked to skin discoloration and a change in the color of the iris when used in patients with lighter eyes. However, this latter side effect is really only a concern when bimatoprost is put in the eye, not around it. "It's a side effect that was discovered during <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>clinical trials for bimatoprost eye drops</a> that are prescribed to glaucoma patients. And only about 1 percent of people in the trial for the glaucoma eye drops experienced eye color change," explains Dr. Baum.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Hilal-Campo adds that bimatoprost and its cousins (PGF2 alpha analogs, which can be sold OTC) can also contribute to periorbital fat atrophy, causing sunken eyes and a deepening of the upper eyelid hollow; plus, chronic dry eyes from damage to the meibomian glands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because the ingredients in OTC lash serums aren't as potent as those in prescription formulas, they may also be less effective, explains certified physician assistant <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nevada Norris, PA</a>. "Over-the-counter lash serums often contain less potent ingredients and still provide some benefits for lash health and appearance, but are usually less powerful than prescription serums," says Norris.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-lash-serum></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Get the Most Out of Your Lash Serum</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you get a prescription or OTC option, Dr. Hilal-Campo recommends performing a patch test. "Any lash serum can cause an allergic reaction, so you really should patch test the serum for 24 to 48 hours on the inner arm before using," says Dr. Hilal-Campo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your patch test goes well, you can start applying it, keeping in mind that consistency is key. Most lash serums will instruct you to apply the serum daily, but follow the instructions on your package closely. "It's also important to note that once you stop using the serums, the increased lash hair growth that resulted from using the serums will cease, as well," says Dr. Baum.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lash-serums-the-pros-love></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lash Serums the Pros Love</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both Dr. Baum and Norris swear by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Latisse</a> and constantly recommend it to their patients . "It has proven to be the most effective among my patients and myself," says Norris. Dr. Baum adds: "Usually, results may appear within four weeks, but full results take sixteen weeks."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you prefer an OTC option, Dr. Baum recommends <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Neutrogena Healthy Lash and Brow</a> ($14) and Norris recommends <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Alphalash</a> ($132). <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Envious Lashes</a> founder <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>Clementina Richardson</a> recommends the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel=nofollow>Lash Conditioning Serum</a> ($59) from her line. And Dr. Hilal-Campo recommends <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6 rel=nofollow>The Ordinary Multipeptide Lash Serum</a> ($15), <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=7 rel=nofollow>Vegamour GRO Lash</a> ($72), and, of course,&nbsp;the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=8 rel=nofollow>Get Growing Lash and Brow Serum</a> ($52) from her line. "My Get Growing Serum does not contain any analogs of PGF2 alpha, and it does not need or have a preservative in it, which can be irritating and exacerbate dry eyes," says Dr. Hilal-Campo. "It is actually soothing and hydrates the lashes, lids, and eyes."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w6hkpZmjnXq0sdGupKxlp6S%2FrHmWcm5ub2Rn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
