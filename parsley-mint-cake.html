Parsley and mint in cake form?&nbsp; I thought it sounded crazy, but I was dying to try it and was mesmerized by the dark green color. I’ve made <a href=# rel=nofollow>basil ice cream</a> in the past that surprised me and wanted to see if I would have the same reaction with the parsley mint cake.</p><p>I did! The cake was delicious. The process started as if I were making pesto. This “base” was used in making the rest of the cake instead of adding butter. One thing that was different too was that it was baked in a jelly roll pan instead of a traditional cake pan. Once the cake was done, I understood why.</p><p>While the cake was sweet and savory, the flavors were intense (in a good way), so you didn’t need a large slice. I took it to work to share with my coworkers and it won rave reviews! We all brainstormed over how to serve it. We came up with ice cream, warm with melted butter, after dinner as a palate cleanser or just a small piece with tea. I am curious though&nbsp;to see how it would bake in a traditional cake pan with frosting.</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><p>4 cups tightly packed, from about 5 bunches parsley leaves<br>1 cup tightly packed, from 2 bunches mint leaves<br>¾ cup good olive oil, plus more for the pan<br>2 cups plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br>1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch<br>2 ¼ teaspoons salt<br>1 ½ teaspoons <a href=# id=auto-tag_baking data-tag=baking>baking</a> powder<br>4 large eggs, at room temperature<br>1 2/3 cups sugar</p><p>Note: I let the batter sit for 24 hours before baking. It deepened in color greatly.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Cheryl Vivian</a> is a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>neurotic baker</a>&nbsp;who came to D.C. via Detroit, Chicago, and New York City.
