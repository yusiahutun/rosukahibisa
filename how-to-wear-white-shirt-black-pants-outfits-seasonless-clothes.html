I have a long black blazer that I got at Topshop (<strong>Shop Similar: </strong>$110; nordstrom.com) a couple of years ago that never lets me down, whether I'm wearing it to work for an important meeting or over a dress when those summer evenings get chilly. And, a white T-shirt, because we all need a good white tee to throw on during those days where you want to be comfortable but still look decent.
