I just eat mindfully and make sure my fish is well-sourced.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My favourite, easy-to-make healthy breakfast is avocado with smoked salmon in a gluten-free multi-seed pita.

I drizzle them in olive oil and salt before crisping them up in the Aga,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Instead of coffee, I have pre-workout matcha, which I whizz up with oat milk and ice in the blender. I love oat milk and brown rice milk, so always stock my fridge up with these.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Up until three years ago, I used to think the egg white was the healthiest part and wasted the yolk. But the yolk contains all the goodness and vitamin D. I love scrambling egg and tofu together with brown rice and broccoli, then adding a little honey, tamari, sesame oil, and mixing it all together to make a healthy teriyaki dish.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">King doesn’t believe in low fat, high protein, or low-carb meals, nor juice diets or skinny teas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Her one piece of advice for 2018</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Walk everywhere. “Go for walks on lunch breaks and weekends – even start walking to work, if you can.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Steph Elswood, health blogger and dancer – @healthychefsteph, 167,000 followers</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What’s in her fridge</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I eat mostly vegan, which means I consume no meat, eggs, milk or cheese,” said Elswood. “As a result, my fridge is always packed with colourful fruits and veggies.” These include courgettes, ginger, avocados, cucumber, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, broccoli, spinach, onions, strawberries and blueberries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I make curries and stews a lot – they’re warming, delicious, and save me from this cold weather. I have dates that keep for longer than most fruit, and buy beetroot in a vacuum pack in case I ever fancy it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“To mix things up, I find other vegetables that I don’t use as frequently. For this week, I have chosen a butternut squash, which I plan to make into a pie.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Elswood added that she combines plant-based items to create a “complete protein” source that has an adequate proportion of all nine essential amino acids.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Examples of this are pita and hummus, peanut butter on wholegrain toast, or rice and black beans.

Pre-plan your workouts and walk in with confidence. No one will question you – they’re all too busy concentrating on themselves.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Matt Law, model – @mattclaw, 99,000 followers</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What’s in his fridge</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Typically, I eat oily fish, such as salmon, once a week, and lean meats or white fish on the other days,” Law said. “I try to have at least one plant-based day a week, replacing animal protein with plant based high-protein substitutes such as black beans or lentils.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said that instead of buying in bulk, he’ll buy just enough for a few days, which presumably avoids wastage. “I travel a lot, so this suits my schedule, and the added benefit is the food I’m eating is fresh,” he said. “Seasonal vegetables are a good option, too. They tend to be cheaper and you can sometimes pick up boxes of mixed seasonal vegetables.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">His one piece of advice for 2018</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He advises people to schedule a workout on a Saturday or Sunday. “Having a couple of rest days in the week is a better idea than leaving it for the weekend,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He doesn’t advocate “cheat days”. “All you’re doing by having a day off from your regular diet is reminding your taste buds of all the bad foods they’ve missed,” he said. “Wait until you’ve reached your goal, then slowly introduce the odd treat.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He added that it takes about 21 days of healthy eating to overcome your junk food habits.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Deni Kirkova, personal trainer and journalist – @denikirkova, 16.800 followers</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What’s in her fridge</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As a vegan, my diet is 100 per cent plant-based,” Kirkova said. “I try to just eat raw food like fruit, lots of veg, and some nuts. Smoothies and whole fruit make up 40 to 50 per cent of my diet on a good day.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I fill my smoothies with all kinds of fruit and veg but most of the time there’s banana and spinach as a base. I’ve been adding peaches, plums, cashews, and almonds, as well as avocado for intense creaminess and silkiness. I blend my smoothies using ice cold water from the fridge, and I also add maca and turmeric for an energy boost and anti-inflammatory benefits.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She is a big fan of raw fermented kimchi and sauerkraut for gut health and de-bloating, which are both staples in her fridge. “Hiding behind it is some falafel, which I have with hummus as an on-the-go meal. On the bottom left are some oats, which I’ll have as porridge for breakfast or brunch, usually with protein powder and soy milk.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The vegan butter on the top shelf may go on some wholegrain granary toast, because – yes – I love bread.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Her one piece of advice for 2018</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I used to be obsessed with macros as a bikini fitness model, but now I don’t count them, even if I do have some protein powder at times for an amino boost. Nowadays, I’m all about getting micronutrient dense foods tightly packed into my diet.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">George Lloyd, fitness model and Barry’s Bootcamp Trainer – @georgelloydfitness, 15.200 followers</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What’s in his fridge</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lloyd said that while he believes training effectively is essential, diet is the main variable in achieving a healthy lifestyle and appearance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Typically, my diet consists of high proteins, high fats, and low carbohydrates on a regular basis. Depending on my schedule or training regime, I will adjust these accordingly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The protein sources I tend to stick by consist of lean meats, such as turkey or chicken breasts, as well as a lot of fish and seafood, such as salmon, tuna, and prawns.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In terms of the carbohydrates, I keep everything wholegrain. My main intakes of carbs tend to be as soon as I wake up, with some oats, almond milk, and banana or blueberries, and then again straight after I have finished training to replenish the glycogen stores in my muscles.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">His one piece of advice for 2018</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He advises people to load up on veg and greens for lower carb meals. “This will keep you fuller for longer and satisfy those sugary cravings that most people come across straight after consuming a meal.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also suggests you find yourself a workout partner. “Training with a friend will motivate you to train harder.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Vicky Hadley, personal trainer, blogger, and model – @vickyhadleyfitness, 14.700 followers</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What’s in her fridge</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I have probably tried every diet out there, from Paleo to juice diets, without much luck as I struggled to work out which diet worked best for me,” Hadley said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now she follows a gluten and dairy-free diet, “but I’m a very flexible dieter. This means I track macronutrients (carbs, fats and proteins) which works extremely well for me.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I eat a mostly plant-based diet using proteins such as beans, tofu, legumes and nuts, but I do eat fish, eggs, and, on the very rare occasion, lean meats. I particularly love sweet potato and butternut squash, as it’s filling without causing the bloating that some grains do.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her favourite smoothie recipe is a chocolate protein powder blended with a dairy free milk, such as almond milk, and spinach with frozen banana and frozen berries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If I was craving ice cream I’d freeze some bananas and blend them up with chocolate protein powder and end up with a healthier chocolate ice cream. Or, if I wanted a pizza, I’d go to a supermarket and get a gluten-free base and buy the ingredients to make one at home. It ends up being cheaper and healthier, and you don’t get the lethargic feelings afterwards.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Her one piece of advice for 2018</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Only eat the foods you tend to binge on while you’re eating out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Alex Gildea, personal trainer – @gildeafitness, 6.900 followers</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What’s in his fridge</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gildea said the while he and his partner have no specific diet, they always try to cook from scratch.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A typical weekly shop consists of fresh vegetables, fruit and well-sourced meat and fish. We keep it balanced with foods such as grains, pulses, wholewheat pasta and rice.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We also try and keep it vegetarian once per week. We both have very busy work schedules, so the balanced meals we make help to keep our blood sugars stable, thus keeping our energy levels high.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">His one piece of advice for 2018</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His main nuggets of advice to people on a health kick this year are to remember that food is fuel. “It’s not about filling yourself up for the whole day, it’s for the next few hours before you eat again. If fat loss is your goal, eat smaller portions on a regular basis to help keep your metabolic rate high.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And according to Gildea, you should forget fat-free, as he agrees it doesn’t mean healthier. “It’s often replaced by sugars and sweeteners that make you crave more. Read the nutritional labels so you know which products are better than others.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Finally, he said that there’s really no such thing as a cheat day. “If you want it then eat it, but just make sure the next snack or meal is a good one.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Original Source:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqmdn6W5pnnEr5ynrKNkrrPAyJyjnmdiZoBxhZhqZqytoqW%2Fqr%2FIp55mnp%2BksbR5xaKrp52jqHqqusWlrJ6mk5q%2FtHnEmqtmq6SWxm64xJql</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
