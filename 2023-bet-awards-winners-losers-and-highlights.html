The show ran for about four hours, with this year’s event celebrating 50 years of Hip Hop, awarding a long-overdue Lifetime Achievement Award to<strong> Busta Rhymes</strong>.</p><p>During the award presentation, <strong>Marlon Wayans</strong> called the rap artist “in a word, brilliant,” adding, “Busta, everybody knows he deserves it, good brother, great dude.” Swizz Beatz hailed Busta for his impact on music, saying he inspired many people in the room.</p><p>A video segment showed<strong> Sean Combs, Janet Jackson, Dave Chapelle, Chuck D</strong>, and others giving Busta his due.</p><p>The award presentation and speech ran for 30 minutes, but it was worth it is seeing Busta get emotional and speak on pieces of his journey in the business.&nbsp; Getting the award, he said, “All right – so… I’m going to wear it on my sleeve – I do want to cry.”</p><p>Speaking on his career, he said, “I would call the studio sets, and when I found out who was in them, I would just pop. I knew there was going to be happy to see me anyway, popping in the street,” he said. “So I would pull up to the studio, and I would act like I was working in those studio rooms the night before, and I forgot something in there.</p><p>“I got my white owl cigar, chocolate burning already, I knew once I passed it to the MCs and they saw it in that session, they couldn’t kick me out.”</p><p>He said that he made a living initially by collaborating with the artists on hand and getting paid for his contributions.</p><p>The show gave Hip Hop’s 50th anniversary its due – with celebratory events since the Super Bowl LVI halftime show in February 2022. Dozens of artists, past and present, were a part of that tribute set. Additionally, the show was performance heavy, with<strong> Ice Spice, Lil Uzi Vert, GloRilla, Coco Jones, Latto, Patti LaBelle</strong> and others taking the BET stage.</p><p><strong>Drake</strong> led the nominees with seven, <strong>21</strong> <strong>Savage</strong> and <strong>Lizzo</strong> had five each, while <strong>Burna Boy, Chris Brown, Ice</strong> <strong>Spice, SZA</strong> and<strong> Beyoncé</strong> had four.</p><p><span><strong>Highlights:</strong></span></p><p><strong>Offset</strong> and <strong>Quavo, </strong>the remaining members of <strong>Migos, </strong>put their emotions and differences aside to perform, paying tribute to their late friend and bandmate <strong>Takeoff</strong>. It sharply contrasted to the two rappers fist-fighting backstage at the Grammys in February after Quavo allegedly wouldn’t allow Offset to be included in a tribute to the late Migos member.</p><p>The performance, not announced publicly, came as a floor-to-ceiling rocket appeared on the screens behind the stage, and the two walked out surrounded by smoke. They went into the track “Hotel Lobby,” dancing and yelling into the mic, “Do it for Take!” The rocket then turned into a photo of the late rapper, who was fatally shot in November 2022 – getting caught up in the crossfire of a situation he had no involvement with.</p><p>The two then performed “Bad and Boujee,” nominated for a Grammy in 2018 for best rap performance. The surprise performance is the first for Offset and Quavo since Takeoff’s death. The future of Migos is unclear, but Offset’s wife, <strong>Cardi B,</strong> tweeted after the performance, “I can’t take it right now <img draggable=false src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f622.svg alt=😢 width=21 height=21 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img draggable=false src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f979.svg alt=🥹 width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">…proud of the boys,” </span>and she isn’t alone judging by the responses online.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=#>#BETAwards</a></p><p>Is that Offset AND Quavo on stage together?!!!<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kuLgl0dtrN</a></p><p>— Rachel.

Best male and female R&B/Pop artist, album of the year, best male hip-hop artist, best group, movie, best actor and actress and sportsman and woman of the year were not even mentioned in the broadcast.</p><p><strong><span>Winners:</span></strong></p><p><strong>~ Coco Jones</strong> for winning best new artist. It was a surprise considering she had just three nominations, and <strong>GloRilla</strong> came into the show with six. She also had fewer than newcomer Ice Spice. She’s the first female R&B singer (not rapper) to win since SZA won the award in 2018.</p><p><strong><span>Headscratchers:</span></strong></p><p>~ The iconic <strong>Patti LaBelle</strong> was not the best as she took the stage in tribute to the late great <strong>Tina Turner,</strong> who passed away in May at 83 after a long illness. While singing “The Best” in tribute to her friend, she forgot the lyrics saying, “What if I can’t see … the words … I don’t know?” LaBelle (79) said, squinting to see the teleprompter. “I’m tryin,’ y’all!” she said as the audience members watched.</p><p>::Scratching head:: – How do you not memorize or know the words to the Tina Turner song you’re singing in tribute – absurd and a tad disrespectful, maybe? Alas, she’s a Queen, and all will be forgiven and forgotten. Flashcards next time, Ms. LaBelle – written in BIG BLOCK BOLD letters.</p><p><strong>~ Teyana “Spike Tey” Taylor took home the Video Director of the Year award </strong>with her mom, Nikki Taylor accepting the award on her behalf. Mama Nikki called Taylor while accepting the trophy on Facetime, hmmmm? In any case, kudos to Taylor who beat out fellow nominees <strong>A$AP Rocky, Benny Boom, Burna Boy, Cole Bennett, Dave Free, Kendrick Lamar</strong> and<strong> Director X.</strong></p><p>Full list of nominees and winners are below.</p><p><strong>BEST ACTOR<u><br></u></strong>Amin Joseph<br>Brian Tyree Henry<br>Damson Idris — WINNER<br>Daniel Kaluuya<br>Demetrius ‘Lil Meech’ Flenory Jr.<br>Donald Glover<br>Michael B.
