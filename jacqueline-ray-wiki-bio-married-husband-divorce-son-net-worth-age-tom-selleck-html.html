Despite the colorful on-going career of famous public figures, their front may not match their on-screen success!</p><p style=text-align:justify>Similarly, Jacqueline Ray, a former actress, has breathed her success in Hollywood for a long time, but her life behind the cameras is filled with endless struggles. From failed marriages to being handcuffed, Jacqueline's life has been a roller coaster ride.</p><p style=text-align:justify>So, without further ado, let's discuss the events of Jacqueline's personal life along with her wiki-bio!&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Low-Profile First Husband; Married Famous Actor And Producer</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Jacqueline Ray is a prominent name in the entertainment industry for decades, and to some extent, her love life has also played its part in gathering the fame.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Jacqueline&nbsp;first&nbsp;tied the knot with Shephard, whose information is limited to his last name only. Though the couple has hidden their most of their married life including&nbsp;wedding details, it was known that&nbsp;the couple welcomed a son, Kevin in 1966.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Interesting</strong>:-&nbsp;<a href=# title="Rita Ora, Relationship With Ex-Boyfriend Again?

She Just Split With One</a></p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Meanwhile, the former married couple who were rarely seen together in public eventually divorced and parted their ways.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Moving on, Jacqueline&nbsp;found love again, with&nbsp;famous actor and film&nbsp;producer, Tom Selleck. They began dating&nbsp;in 1970. After&nbsp;sharing&nbsp;romance with each other&nbsp;for a year, they exchanged their vows on 15 May 1971 and soon became&nbsp;one of the most popular couples in Hollywood.</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Jacqueline Ray with Tom Selleck on their wedding day&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: Cosmopolitan.com)&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Unfortunately, many fans got disappointed when Jacqueline filed for divorce. Despite sharing a romantic married life for eleven years, they ended their relationship without disclosing the precise reason.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The pair divorced in 1982. Following the divorce, Tom starred in a movie called Divorce Wars: A Love Story as a lead. The film allowed Tom to pour his heart out into his on-screen character.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Read Also</strong>:-&nbsp;<a href=# title="Tracey Edmonds Has A Boyfriend!

Moved Towards Deion Sanders After Ending Married Life With Singer Husband</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Furthermore, Tom had adopted Jacqueline's son, Kevin from her&nbsp;first marriage and even gave him his surname. Tom raised Kevin with care as his beloved son despite having gone through a&nbsp;divorce with Jacqueline.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The father-son duo has even been featured as co-stars in numerous movies including Magnum P.I. as grandfather and grandson. Kevin is married to Anabella Selleck, who has wardrobe assistant credit on the TV series All Saints. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Jacqueline's son, Kevin Selleck who was later adopted by her husband&nbsp;</strong><strong>Tom Selleck&nbsp;from the&nbsp;second marriage&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: celebritywc.com)&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Moreover, in 2016, Jacqueline' ex-husband, Tom opened up to RadarOnline&nbsp;about how his memories of married life with her came back to life during the screening of 'made for cable' series. He emotionally opened up saying that their 'bust-up' was the worst thing ever,&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>“The bust-up was the worst thing that ever happened to me. I thought I’d be married for always.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>According to RadarOnline, Tom moved to Hawaii for the shoot, and he was attracted to date the beautiful Hawaiian girls,</p><p style=text-align:justify>“Tom is a very charming guy. He fell in love with the island and with the island girls.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><span style=color:#000>Two years later after their divorce, he would confess his ill-treatment of Jacqueline in an interview with Pens & Patron. In a remorse tone, he spoke like a man living with regrets and guilts. The Magnum P.I. actor confessed:</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=color:#000>“I’ve found it very difficult to expose my private life and live with it. It’s important to nurture your marriage. I think wanting time away from work has been good for that.”</span></p><p style=text-align:justify>On the other hand, Jacqueline was devastated by Tom's action, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>[She] “was crushed by the way their marriage hit the skids when he hit the big time — and thought it showed how fickle Tom could be. She never suspected Tom would dump her after she had stood behind him during all the lean years&nbsp;when he was a struggling actor looking for a major role.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p style=text-align:justify>However, Jacqueline tied the knot for the third time with Clarence Barry Witmer on March 21 in the year 1992 with whom she shares a daughter, Umeko. But again, the information on her third married life, as well as the identity of her third husband, remains private within the couple.</p><p style=text-align:justify>As for her ex-husband Tom, he's married to his present wife&nbsp;Jillie Jean Mack for about thirty years now. Tom and Jillie share a daughter together.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Meanwhile, in early 2014, Jacqueline got herself into a pile of&nbsp;controversy after the police arrested her for hiring a stranger to murder her son-in-law.&nbsp;She claimed that she was afraid for her daughter, who was suffering abuse and violence from her husband, Leon Baucham. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>You May Also Like</strong>:-&nbsp;<a href=# title="Zach Braff Not Ready To Get Married Even After Dating And Romance With Number Of Girlfriends?" rel=follow>Zach Braff Not Ready To Get Married Even After Dating And Romance With Number Of Girlfriends?</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>She later disclosed that she handed a total of $12,000 to the killer to get her son-in-law killed. As a result, the court sentenced twenty-nine years in prison to the accused and Jacqueline was sentenced to eighteen years in prison.&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Jacqueline Ray's Wiki-Like Bio Including Age & Net Worth</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Jacqueline Ray was&nbsp;born&nbsp;in Burbank, California&nbsp;in 1963.
