But it’s a really fun scene, so it was all worth it,” he told Variety on Monday (December 11).</p><p>As it is a nude scene, Glen Powell knew he wouldn’t look “cool” so he “had to grip it and rip it” when filming it for Anyone But You.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Titanic director refused to cast tall actors to save millions of dollars</a></p><p>Also, Sydney, 26, joked she is&nbsp;“very acquainted” with Glen Powell after he checked on her when something unexpected happened on set. She had been bitten by a spider they were using while filming Anyone But You.</p><p>“There’s the spider itself, which actually bit me, and that was a whole thing. And then we have the part of Glen bending over and me checking to see if there are more spiders … I’m very acquainted with Glen now,” said the <a href=#>Euphoria</a> actress.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-love-affair-between-co-stars>A love affair between co-stars?</h2><p>There have been questions whether Glen Powell and his Anyone But You co-star<a href=#> have something going on behind the scenes</a>. Although during filming they were both in committed relationships, with Sydney even being engaged. Sydney and Glen have both consistently denied they are a <a href=#>celebrity couple</a>.</p><p>Glen told Men’s Health: “When all that stuff happened, you know, publicly, it felt disorienting and unfair. But what I’m realizing is that’s just a part of this gig now.”</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#>TV</a> star Sydney was far more relaxed and said in an interview with Variety: “It’s a rom-com. That’s what people want! Glen and I don’t really care. We have so much fun together, and we respect each other so much.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Amanda Bynes’ cosmetic surgery was ‘the best thing she’s ever done’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aAcLnOr6CeZaOprrN5wKWkqKukYrGqscNmnaKknZ67qHnRmpqyZaOYsq%2BxjLCgraBdmLxuv9OaqWaapal6qsCMsJisZaekv7W0jKKraA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
