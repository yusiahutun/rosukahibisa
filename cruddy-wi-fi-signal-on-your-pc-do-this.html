The Wi-Fi hack we're about to share is a simple way to get better Wi-Fi reception for your computer.</p><p>It works for desktop PCs, and it can even work for some laptops, depending on how you get Wi-Fi on your laptop. But what it can't do is make Wi-Fi out of nothing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Tips to Improve Your Wi-Fi Signal</a></span></p><p>If the signal from your Wi-Fi router at the location of your computer is extremely weak or not even present, then that's a bigger issue you need to address first.</p><p>We'd recommend using <a href=#>these tips to improve your Wi-Fi signal at the router</a> and then, if necessary, move on to dealing with the signal strength where your computer is located.

It gets the antenna above <a href=#>the stuff blocking the signal</a>. Let's say your PC is sitting on your desk and your Wi-Fi router is a few rooms over.</p><p>The metal shielding in the computer itself can mess with the signal (which is why desktop PCs have external Wi-Fi antennas). The metal shielding in your computer monitor doesn't help, either. Even your body absorbs some signal if you're between the antenna and the router. Everything else between the antenna and the router also dampens the signal and, in our homes, the majority of all that "stuff" is about desk height.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So if your router is on a side table in the living room and your computer is on your desk across the house, there's a whole lot of waist-height junk between the two antennas.</p><p>Simply unscrewing the antennas off the back of your PC, attaching extension cables, and then screwing the existing antenna into extension cables can help you get the antennas up and away from the radio-blocking stuff.</p><p>The connection points on Wi-Fi antennas are standardized and use a connection format called SMA (SubMiniature version A)---it looks a lot like a little miniature version of the coax cables you use for your cable box because that's exactly what it is.</p><p>You can use <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">a 3-foot extension</a> to get it on top of the PC case or a little up the wall, or even <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">a 10-foot extension</a> to get it all the way to the ceiling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/31qe8lhbd6l-_sl500_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Eightwood Dual Band Wi-Fi Adapter</h5><p class=display-card-description>Get the antenna out from behind your PC with this handy extension and antenna combo.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$16 at Amazon</a><p>You can even replace the existing antenna with <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">this extension + base</a> for a more convenient way to place the antenna high up on the top of your case or a nearby shelf.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're using a USB Wi-Fi dongle, you can use the same trick.
