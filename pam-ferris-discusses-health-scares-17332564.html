But at the time it can be a hard thing to overcome.”</p><p>Fans will see Pam’s character Sister Evangelina fall ill when Call The Midwife returns for its fourth series tonight. And she said her own scares helped her do the emotional plot justice.</p><p>Pam said: “As an actor you draw on your own experiences and it is frightening playing a storyline like this. Sister Evangelina is suddenly feeling her own mortality – she’s worried this could be curtains.</p><p>“The truth is we’re all frightened of that happening. It doesn’t matter how much faith we might have, knowing we could have a serious disease isn’t easy.”</p><p>She added: “You’ll see in the new series that Sister Evangelina gets very spiky about it. And that’s because she’s scared.</p><p>“She feels that her purpose in life is blocked and she’s asking herself how she can believe in a God that would call you to do things and then make you so ill you couldn’t do them.</p><p>“There’s an internal challenge going on for her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19678569.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/ferris2-187268><p>The BBC1 drama, which pulls in more than ten million viewers every episode, has brought Pam a new generation of fans.
