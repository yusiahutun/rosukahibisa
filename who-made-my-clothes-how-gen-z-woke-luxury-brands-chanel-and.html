If one of their suppliers has contracted to a factory that shouldn’t be making their clothes and they’re found not to be compliant, they can say ‘They’re not a registered supplier and shouldn’t have been making the clothes’. It should be a win-win. I don’t know why all brands aren’t doing it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The most important catalyst to that change, Somers says, isn’t a single demographic, but a single question.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As consumers we really have power over these brands, we can use our voice and our power to bring about change – and we really need to do that,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So asking the question ‘Who made my clothes?’ is really powerful.
