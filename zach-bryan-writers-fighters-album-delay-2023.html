"I love you guys and I apologize I said something I didn’t stick to. Mercy here please."</p><p>Bryan did not give a specific reason for the postponement of new music, but simply says, "Going to let my life play out."</p><p>The new project&nbsp;would have been his sophomore major-label studio album. In November,&nbsp;Bryan revealed&nbsp;— also in a&nbsp;tweet — that the album would be called&nbsp;Writers and Fighters,&nbsp;adding, "I have never been more excited for anything in my life."</p><p>Although new music will have to wait a bit longer, Bryan has been busy in the past year with a myriad of projects. He made his major-label debut in May 2022 with his 34-track American Heartbreak album, which contains his multi-Platinum hit "Something in the Orange."</p><p>In July,&nbsp;he released his nine-track Summertime Blues EP, so fans haven't been hurting for new music.</p><p>He went to work yet again and made a statement about Ticketmaster's practices with his live album, <a href=#>All My Homies Hate Ticketmaster</a>, released on Christmas Day in 2022.&nbsp;That project&nbsp;features 24 songs, all of which were recorded live at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado.</p><p>Although Bryan anticipated fan disappointment in his announcement, many of the early responses were gracious. One fan wrote, "brother… you literally just dropped 3 in one year…we can wait it’s all good."</p><p>Another added, "I’d rather you deliver a product you feel secure in than sticking to a deadline and having regret. You’re the antithesis to Nashville deadlines, and I think we all love that."</p><p>Zach Bryan is still set to take off on his headlining <a href=#>Burn, Burn, Burn Tour</a>, kicking off May 10 in&nbsp;Charlottesville, Va. The 28-date tour will run through Aug. 30 in&nbsp;Kansas City, Mo.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>See the Most Played Country Song from the Year You Were Born</h2><p>Who had the most played country song during the year you were born?
