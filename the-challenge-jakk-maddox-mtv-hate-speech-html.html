I can see that guy being a pedo for sure.” The tweet caught Jakk’s attention, and he made an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram reel</a>&nbsp;about it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-4_59>Although he claimed it didn’t personally “offend” him, the rookie said it pushes a “dangerous” homophobic narrative. Additionally, he pointed out it the remark is under a picture of him on the show’s main page and believes MTV should’ve responded. Jakk also posted a video of him presumably speaking with a producer about the situation to his Instagram story.</p><p id=par-5_51>In a caption, he claimed he asked the network to “issue a statement condemning hate speech” but said they refused. “Sucks that this is where we are.” The comment in question is no longer available on&nbsp;The Challenge’s Twitter page, but the network hasn’t made any public statements about the remark yet.</p><h2><strong>Jakk debuted on ‘The Challenge: Ride or Dies’</strong></h2><p id=par-6_22>After meeting&nbsp;Free Agents&nbsp;champ Laurel Stucky on&nbsp;Peak of Love, the two developed a friendship and competed on&nbsp;The Challenge: Ride or Dies&nbsp;as a team.</p><p id=par-7_14>They unexpectedly found themselves nominated for the first elimination, but the dagger saved them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-8_47>The pair flew under the radar until episode 5 when his friend Jay Starrett turned on the duo to his partner Michele Fitzgerald’s paranoia about Laurel. After sending Kim Tränka and Colleen Schneider home, they ended up in the following elimination against Aneesa Ferreira and Jordan Wiseley.</p><p id=par-9_47>The veterans sent them home by the sixth episode, ending their game fairly early. After the season, Jakk claimed Jay reached out to him wanting to make amends, but the&nbsp;Ex on the Beach&nbsp;star blocked him after believing the&nbsp;Survivor&nbsp;standout only wanted to <a href=#>use the moment to create content.</a></p><h2><strong>Jakk originally appeared on ‘Ex on the Beach: Peak of Love’</strong></h2><p id=par-10_18>In 2019, Jakk made his reality TV debut on the dating experiment&nbsp;<a href=#>Ex on the Beach: Peak of Love.</a></p><p id=par-11_18>He arrived in the New Zealand-based chalet during episode 2 as&nbsp;Drag Race 6&nbsp;star and&nbsp;American Idol&nbsp;alum Adore Delano’s ex.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-12_36>The two initially wanted to rekindle their relationship, but Jakk hooked up with castmate Marlon Williams, upsetting Adore.
