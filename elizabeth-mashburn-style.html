In this series for Harper’s Bazaar, I will be “outfit dissecting” women who work behind the scenes in the fashion industry. The women you will meet in these profiles work for some of your favorite brands, and whether they’re designing the pieces you love or answering your DM questions, they are also quietly cultivating trends.
I traveled back to Atlanta to interview Elizabeth Mashburn in her home in Buckhead—a place that looks as casually chic and cool as Elizabeth always does."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I write copy about new products that launch online; I create email campaigns to sell those new products; I do things like window decals for stores. Anything that needs to be creative or designed, or made to sound better is what I’m tasked with.</p><img alt="Arm, Hand, Shoulder, Gesture, Finger, Photography, Stock photography, Formal wear, Wrist, Elbow, " title="Arm, Hand, Shoulder, Gesture, Finger, Photography, Stock photography, Formal wear, Wrist, Elbow, " width=1080 height=834 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/photo2-1566585227.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">LULU GRAHAM</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60">How would you describe what you do to a toddler?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I write little stories about pieces of clothing so that you can decide whether or not you want to buy it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60">So you did the first logo for Sid Masburn?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yes! It was a font that my dad had on his computer and really liked. I started to see it in other logos; I think there’s a valet parking company in Buckhead that uses the font or a general contractor. We started to feel like it was a little stiff so, probably in 2013, I did it again by hand.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60">Where do you live and where did you grow up?<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I live in Atlanta, but I've moved around a ton. My phone number is a Madison, Wisconsin area code. I was born in New York, then we moved out to Connecticut. We were in San Diego for a year, Charlottesville, Virginia for a year. Went back to New York, then we were in Madison. I moved to Atlanta in 2007, when my parents were starting their business. I was in my last year of high school, so I was totally checked out. I was very interested in what they were doing business-wise, but I didn't know anything about Atlanta. I spent my time at my parents' house, school, and the store—that was it.</p><img alt="Font, Text, Label, Circle, " title="Font, Text, Label, Circle, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pq1-1566586069.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60">Since you moved around so much, what place do you identify with most?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kind of nowhere! I love Atlanta, but I do not feel like I am from Atlanta. I think that’s why my family and I are so close; because we all are kind of from nowhere. All the little provincial print shirts, I’m like “that seems like home.” Even though it feels like five different versions of home, we had napkins out of that fabric growing up. Home is wherever my family is!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60">Do you think one place had a major effect on your style, or is it the combination of all of them?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I mean, my parents had the biggest influence on my style. I always wanted to look like them. Actually, I had a brief phase where I didn’t.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60">What were your outfits during that phase?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I wore black. I was still dressing like them, I was just like “my parents don’t look like other parents.” I’ve always dressed exactly the same.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60">That’s one thing I love about you; you have extremely consistent style. I really value that in people!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, you do too! Which I guess is why you value it!</p><img alt="Denim, Jeans, Clothing, jean short, Blue, Pocket, Waist, Shorts, Fashion, Textile, " title="Denim, Jeans, Clothing, jean short, Blue, Pocket, Waist, Shorts, Fashion, Textile, " width=1080 height=1534 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/photo3-1566585319.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">LULU GRAHAM</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60">So many people can change so fast. Wear one thing one year and then change the next. I’ve never mentally been able to wrap my head around that!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s very wasteful! Every piece of fashion writing in the entire world talks about investing in classics. It doesn't make me feel good to lean into a trend and be really tired of it. I get very tired of seeing everyone wearing the same thing, and I think that’s fine and fun, and it’s great to participate in trends and moments, but when I think about the things that I actually wear, I want to wear the same three sweaters over and over again. I want to wear the same lug sole until I can't anymore.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60">Tell me the story behind something you’re wearing right now.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The shorts belonged to my mom’s brother, who passed away sadly before I was born, but they were his old jeans. She had a bunch of his jeans in her closet, they were super close, a year apart, they were best friends. So, she had all his old Levi’s in her closet and I cut them off into shorts when I was probably 18 or 19. They are the best! She said, “he would have loved to see you wearing those!” I’ve patched the back—they’re very old! My white shorts are his jeans too. Whatever his size was is exactly perfect!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60">How would you describe your style?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A lot of things I wear are well loved and have a lot of wear behind them. There are definitely some old school preppy classic things about the way I like to dress. Matt Lambert has described it as “WASP-Goth” before, which is a studded belt, Levis, and Belgian Shoes. Definitely more in the winter. Goth is a little heavy! I’m going to show you my wedding dress. There is a part of me that really loves things that look like they are made for babies. I love fluttery sleeves. I made the dress with my mom and Lan. We did this little embroidery that I had drawn out. We made shirts in this organdy fabric.</p><img alt="Text, Font, Label, Circle, " title="Text, Font, Label, Circle, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pq2-1566585348.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60">What do you buy “too much” of?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’m always looking for anything in a French provincial print. I cannot resist anything that is that kind of print. Mostly because it’s not being made anymore. I also probably should be buying more loafers since I end up wearing those all the time. I can never resist a fluttery top.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60">If you could be dropped in any time period strictly for the clothes what would you pick?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Early 60’s is always really great to me. But also, the movie The Favorite, is so pretty. I was so inspired by it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60">What movie had the biggest influence on your style?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Virgin Suicides was huge for me and my sisters. I don’t know if anything they wear is literally what I own or wear, but several people said my wedding dress felt very Virgin Suicides. We watched that movie over and over again. Everything about that movie aesthetically I love and identify with, obviously until the end. My sisters and I all shared stuff, but we all have really different style now.</p><img alt="Leg, Thigh, Hand, Gesture, Finger, Muscle, Photography, Knee, " title="Leg, Thigh, Hand, Gesture, Finger,
