The rapper was born on 6th January 1999. So how old is Polo G, one may ask? The star is currently 20 years old. He was raised by both parents in the Old Town area of Northern Chicago. His childhood was influenced by gangs and danger lurked all over in the dark streets even though this was fairly normal. The older he grew, the more he got into trouble with the law. He even got arrested 6 times, one after another.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7067527ddde1e676.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Chris Isaak's wife?

By the time he turned 15 years, he lost a friend due to gun violence. It is recorded that he went on to lose family and friends too. Apart from his hustling gigs on the streets, he worked on improving his rapping skills. Whatever he earned back then was channelled towards buying his musical equipment and covering for the costs of his studio time. His parents may not have approved his career choice at first but he persisted.</p><p class=align-left>So, where did Polo G go to school? Going by his disturbed childhood, it is not clear where he attended school. He was often in correctional facilities as he would be arrested regularly. He chose to focus on music instead and did very well in it.</p><h3>Polo G net worth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7067527ddde1e676.jpg><p class=align-left>Currently, with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth of $300,000</a>, his value is mainly as a result of his career progression. His first popular song was titled ‘Pop Out.’ Some of his earlier tracks include 'The Come Up’ and ‘Never Cared’ which debuted on ‘SoundCloud, not forgetting the ‘OFFICIAL POLO.G SOUND CLOUD’ mixtape. ‘Gang With Me’ became his first hit single that propelled him to fame.

Its video was uploaded on YouTube on August 2018 and has garnered over 54 million views since then.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/edcf920b38609087.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mbosso bio: real name, wife, parents, house, cars, latest songs</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The song went on to become his breakthrough as it amassed millions of views on YouTube making him even more conspicuous. Soon after major label records came after him expressing interest in signing him. This said, what label is Polo G signed to? He desired to keep his independence as an artist and soon secured a distribution record deal with Columbia Records. He later released ‘Pop Out’ with them and Lil Tjay was featured on it. The tune also amassed millions of YouTube views making it to the 22nd position on the ‘Billboard Hot 100. It was his first charting song.</p><p class=align-left>In <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">an interview</a>, Polo revealed that his first song to record was known as ODA. At the time, he was scared and anxious but slowly became more confident and sang much better. He began by releasing tracks on YouTube in 2017 as a way of catching his fans' attention.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e48f6f1b64c743d9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Swaggy C: net worth, real name, big brother, Bayleigh, his TV</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He continues to work hard and focus on his career even today. His style has always been the Chicago-style rap sound with quick verses. However, recently he has incorporated a more melodic approach as proven by his debut studio album titled 'Die a Legend.’ It was released on June 7, 2019.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Rory John Gates education, net worth, siblings</p><h3>Relationship and marriage</h3><p class=align-left>While Polo may not be married, it is common knowledge that he is in a serious relationship. He is romantically attached to Crystal Blease. It has also been rumoured that they may soon be tying the knot because they are engaged. Polo mentions Crystal in numerous of his posts on ‘Instagram’ as well as ‘Twitter’ accounts, often referring to her as “Mrs. Calpalot.” If this is not an indicator, then I do not know what is. What's more, Polo G also released a song earlier this year in February 2019. He titled the tune ‘Ms. Capalot’ and it is all about his lady love. It already has millions of views so far.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs5fmainl2f6e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Otile Brown biography and other facts about the extraordinary talented musician</span></p></a><h3>Body measurements</h3><p class=align-left>How tall is Polo G?
