The star, 56, was found 'unresponsive' after police were called to her flat in Herne Hill, south-east London, in July last year. 
Detectives did not not treat the star's sudden death as suspicious and today officials said she had died of natural causes. 
'This is to confirm that Ms O'Connor died of natural causes,' a spokesman for Southwark Coroners Court told MailOnline.

Examples of 'non-natural' deaths include road traffic accidents, suicide, drug overdoses and accidents such as drowning, she told HuffPost.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And Dr David Fowler, an anatomic and forensic pathologist, described the manner of death to CNN as dying from a 'natural disease process'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said examples of these are illnesses that 'are going to carry us off at some point along the way', such as infections or heart disease.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If I'm playing a sport and have a heart attack… or shovel snow and have a heart attack because I stressed myself, that's natural,' Dr Fowler said. 'But if a person playing sport was to die from something caused by the activity, such as a head injury, that death would not be ''natural''. There is a difference between the ''cause'' and ''manner'' of death.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And despite the fact the term is death by 'natural causes', this is actually the 'manner' of death - the determination of how the injury or disease leads to death. The coroner rules whether the manner of death was natural, accidental, or due to suicide or homicide. Whereas the 'cause' is the disease or injury itself that leads to death, such as stroke.</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span> <span style=font-size:16px>Ms O'Connor&nbsp; died</span><span style=font-size:16px>&nbsp;18 months after the mother-of-four's son Shane, 17, took his life in January 2022 after escaping hospital.</span><br>In her last Tweet, O'Connor posted a photo of Shane and said: 'Been living as undead night creature since.
