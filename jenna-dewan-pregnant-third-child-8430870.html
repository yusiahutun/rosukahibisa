In a new interview with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Romper</a>, the dancer and actress revealed that she is expecting her third child. It's her second with her fiancé, Steve Kazee, and Dewan shares a daughter, Everly, with her ex-husband, Channing Tatum. Dewan also shared the news via a video on&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>her Instagram</a>, which showed Kazee playing the guitar near a bathtub before the shot panned to Dewan soaking in a sea of bubbles with her bump on display.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Think if I make @stevekazee serenade me every night the baby will get his voice??" she captioned the post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've just entered the second trimester, and I feel alive again,” she told Romper before adding that she and Kazee have decided not to find out the baby's sex. She also reflected on the fact that this pregnancy would be her last, saying, “You don’t race to the end because this is the last time. So, there’s a bit of joy and a little sadness. I’m really trying to enjoy it all and not try to just get through the days.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also added that she enjoys being a mother, saying, “I really love being a mom. That’s something I knew my whole life, but I&nbsp;really&nbsp;know it now.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, she was quick to point out that being pregnant at 43 is very different from the first time she carried a baby, which was at age 32.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m not sure the body necessarily gets right back into action the way it did years ago. We’ll see,” she said. “I’ll report back, but I do think there’s a bit of ignorance, this dancer in me that just says, ‘OK, well, you just get it done.’ I’ve recovered great every time, but I’m open to whatever happens.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>MICHAEL TRAN/AFP via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kazee, for his part, is sure to pitch in. Dewan explained that her fiancé is a great dad and jumped into the role without hesitation.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He’s so naturally domestic and nurturing, and he’s so loving, and he’s funny, and he’s really … he’s just incredible,” she said. “It’s one of those things where people just have a natural ability for parenting. I’m so excited to see him with a little baby again.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dewan and Kazee's son, Callum, is ready to be a big brother. At just 3 years old, Dewan says that he's curious about what's going on and requested that his mom speed things along for his sake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“[I told him] when the baby is ready, the baby comes out. And he’s like, ‘I want the baby right now. Can you just pull it out of your mouth?’ Steve and I&nbsp;died&nbsp;laughing," Dewan shared. "I said, ‘I wish, baby. That would be amazing if we could pull it out [of] my mouth. But no, it definitely goes a different way.’"<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>More in Celeb News</span></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yZ6lp5ldmbK4rc1mp6udl6Our8CMrZ%2BiqpRisKm1y51kcWxjZYV4fA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
