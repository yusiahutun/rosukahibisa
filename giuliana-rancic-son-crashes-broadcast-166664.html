News and, now that she’s settled back into her LA gig, the proud mama brought her adorable son, Duke Rancic, with her to work on Thursday, Sept. 20. 
In a new Instagram video shared by Giuliana, Duke, 6, appeared to be having a lot of fun visiting his mom at her job because, in the clip, Duke can be seen hilariously crashing Giuliana’s broadcast with her co-host Jason Kennedy and doing a funny dance on set!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The fashionista mom even started to chase Duke in a pair of sky-high heels, which made the moment even better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Watch the funny video below!</strong></p><p>“Oh my God, Duke! I did not know that Duke was right [behind me],” she told Jason in the video before trying to persuade her son to leave. “Hi, mommy’s working. This was literally not the plan. Remember you’re supposed to be over there, I got you chocolate.”</p><p>Instead of listening to his embarassed mom, Duke continued to do a funny dance on camera and Giuliana realized that it would take her a while to get her son off the set so she told Jason to “keep going.”&nbsp;</p><p>Jason ended up finishing the segment with Giuliana still running around in the background, so he hilariously walked off saying, “Let me help, here’s your babysitter!”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bill-rancic-giuliana-duke.jpg><p class=caption>Giuliana and her family. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)</p><p>In a previous interview with Us Weekly, Giuliana funnily revealed that her son <a href=# rel=dofollow>doesn’t know what she does</a> for work, so it’s possible that Duke didn’t realize he was interrupting a very popular entertainment show. “Someone asked him, ‘What does your mom do?’ He said, ‘Mommy is a singer!’ He knows I do something on TV. He’s not quite sure what,” Giuliana explained. Duke obviously has a knack for TV, just like his mom!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46goK6kmZa7onnRmqWcoZNiwLC6jJypmquYmsBurtGomJ2bkajBbn2Vb21vbF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
