Sofia looked gorgeous as always donning a floral gown and her long, brunette locks over her shoulders.</p><p>“Still at home,” she captioned the collage of photos, which also featured Joe, 43, holding up Bubbles over his head. The SAG Award winner even shared a pic of the tray of food she put out for Joe, son <a href=#><strong>Manolo Vergara</strong></a> and niece <a href=#><strong>Claudia Vergara</strong></a> to munch on while catching some rays.</p><p>On Sunday, Sofia took the party indoors as she <a href=#>posted a video cooking</a> with her 27-year-old son. The doting mom of one — who shares Manolo with ex-husband Joe Gonzalez — was all smiles while whipping up eggplant parmigiana in their massive kitchen.</p><p>“Cooking [with my love] @manologonzalezvergara and my @dolcegabbana family!” Sofia captioned the clip on May 17. “#StayHome. Make eggplant parmigiana. Proud to be part of the Devotion Campaign which is helping @humanitas.university aid their global health initiatives.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sofia-vergara-and-husband-joe-manganiello-enjoy-outdoor-pool-fun02.jpg><p>By the time their recipe was complete, Sofia took to Instagram to give her fans a look at the final product. “Eggplant parmigiano [on] my plates from Positano!!” the actress <a href=#>captioned a super cute selfie with Manolo</a> as she held up the scrumptious meal.</p><p>Despite being in self-isolation for the past several weeks, Sofia and Joe continue to prove they’ve had no shortage of fun. While chatting with <a href=#>Men’s Health</a> in May 2019, the True Blood actor — who tied the knot with Sofia in 2015 — revealed the longtime lovebirds are actually homebodies at heart.</p><p>“We marathon Netflix and watch shows like Game of Thrones, Mindhunter and Naked and Afraid,” he gushed to the outlet at the time. “When we’re at home, we’re opposites in all the best ways and we’re compatible in all the best ways … Masculine/feminine, yin and yang, whatever you want to call it.”</p><p>We love how Sofia and Joe are thriving!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46spp%2BhkWLDpr7GmqmaZZGjsW601KyZmqaUYrewsYymmKefkaO2prjLqGSeppqkxm671K2bqKeiYr2wu8tmna6mXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
