We are misguided by the assumption that someone’s success is determined by their smartness. Intelligence is indeed an integral part of excellence. But <a href=#>success </a>is not only determined by one’s achievements&nbsp;but is also dependent upon how capable an individual is to persevere in times of adversities. Life is unprecedented at times and we may encounter several challenges in our journey towards triumph. Thus it is necessary to develop skills that enable us to overcome these challenges and to grow out of it. This ability of individuals to overcome hardships is labelled as the adversity quotient.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>Intelligence Quotient vs. Emotional Quotient: Definition, Comparison and Variations</a></strong></p><p>The adversity quotient (AQ) is defined as the ability of an individual to think, manage, direct, and endure challenges and difficulties in life (Utami, Hardjono, and Karyanta, 2014). The concept of AQ was proposed and conceptualized by Dr Paul Stoltz. Stoltz categorized people into three types based on their level of adversity quotient; Quitters, Campers, and Climbers.</p><p>Quitters, as he said, are those who lead compromised lives. They are easily broken by negative events and become hopeless about their success. Also, they quickly quit from every attempt to overcome the barrier and will never try to solve the problem. They will thus have to lead a miserable life. Campers&nbsp;are ready to fight to an extent but even they are not persistent in their efforts. They always prefer a comfortable life and any negative experience will make them scared. They will be happy only if their life flows smoothly. Climbers, on the other hand, are the real achievers.</p><p>They are ready to fight till they attain success regardless of the challenges they face. They will never give up until they achieve their goal. Nothing in life can defeat them. They are self-motivated and consistent with their efforts. They are highly optimistic and never lose hope irrespective of the difficulties they face.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>The Psychology of Consistency</a></strong></p><p>Elizabeth Le Thi (2007) described how the performance of individuals in the workplace will be affected according to which of the above categories they belong to. Quitters are less ambitious people and never take up any complex responsibilities. As a result, they are never an asset to their organization. Campers are willing to put in a minimal amount of effort but they also are average workers so the organization may not be able to achieve the best from them. Climbers, as the researcher said, will be the ideal workforce of an organization as they are highly motivated and committed as well as have an intention to grow and excel in life. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>How do Responsibilities impact&nbsp;us?</a></strong></p><p>However, Stoltz proposed that since the adversity quotient is an acquired trait, it is easy for quitters and campers to learn about how to be a climber. For that, Stoltz formulated the LEAD sequence which consists of the following four guidelines:</p><ul><li>Listen to your response to adversity</li><li>Establish accountability</li><li>Analyze the evidence</li><li>Do something</li></ul><p>In addition to these conceptualizations, Stoltz also proposed four dimensions to measure the adversity quotient. The four dimensions are abbreviated as CORE and are described in the following manner:</p><ul><li><strong>Control</strong>: It is the extent to which individuals are able to manage their lives and control the negative consequences before getting worse.</li><li><strong>Ownership</strong>: It is the extent to which you are accountable for your actions and are willing to take responsibility to make adverse situations better.</li><li><strong>Reach</strong>: It is the extent to which the challenges you face extrapolate to other aspects of your life. It measures how capable are you of preventing such challenges from affecting other necessities such as your profession or family life.</li><li><strong>Endurance</strong>: It is the extent to which you are capable of tolerating pain and yet being optimistic about the future and believing that something positive waits for you on the opposite side of all adversities.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, Shivaranjani (2014) formulated control as determined by resilience and tenacity, ownership by action and engagement, reach by burden and effort, and endurance by hope and willingness to persevere. A study by Lipa (2015) on student leaders found that among the four CORE dimensions, students are at a low level on control and reach compared to ownership and endurance. In addition to these dimensions, the adversity quotient of individuals can also be influenced by several other factors. For instance, Vinas and Malabanan (2015) assessed the association between adversity quotient and coping strategies among college students. The major coping strategies students tend to use to overcome adversities were identified to be the capability to determine adversities, abilities to cope with the adversities immediately, as well as ability to rebuild one’s <a href=#>confidence</a> and social network.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>10 Life Hacks to Slay Hard Times</a></strong></p><p>Success begins when you are willing to move out of your comfort zone and do what others think might be impossible for you. Being highly intelligent and smart is undoubtedly a blessing. But if you are unable to resist and hold out against challenges in life, you will not be to utilize your intelligence and potential to the maximum extent. This is where adversity quotient becomes important. Running away from hardships is easy and effortless. But it takes you nowhere in life. On the other hand, it requires courage and determination to fight with your adversities and to uplift yourself from life stressors. But if you are able to do it, then your life will be transformed like a phoenix bird reborn from ashes.</p><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Education</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Are You Dealing with a Megalomaniac?&nbsp;</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 2, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Education</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Understanding Bipolar: Coping with Different Types</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 2, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Education</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Understanding Seasonal Migraine Triggers: Myths, Causes, and Coping</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Rising Back after SetBacks in Life</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Understanding correlation between attachment styles and life satisfaction:</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmoaenYrGwsdJmmJ2ulafAqsDYZqiup6Sesq%2FAjJ2cn6GemnqwusSsZJqamaG2tcWMraZmnZ6ZwrOxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
