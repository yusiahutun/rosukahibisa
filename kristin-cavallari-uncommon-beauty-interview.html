So when the former MTV Laguna Beach and Very Cavallari star was deciding on her next venture, skincare seemed like the obvious answer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“My skincare routine is the number one question I get, so my team and I decided to bring in the products that I was currently using and investigate the ingredients in them and see how effective they really are,” Cavallari tells BAZAAR.com exclusively. “We quickly started going down a rabbit hole and I realized what I thought were good, clean products were actually not good for my skin at all.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cavallari and her team spent a year coming up with ingredient-focused formulas that the star would be satisfied using herself. The result: Uncommon Beauty, launching on May 13, 2021.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The whole idea of Uncommon Beauty was to create really clean, effective products,” she explains, “But we also don’t want you to have 20 steps, so we’re stripping your routine down to a handful of products that will get the job done.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The products will launch under the Uncommon James brand umbrella, her jewelry label that has expanded into lifestyle brand UJ Home and children’s line Little James. Uncommon Beauty is launching in May with five core products: a foaming face wash loaded with enzymes, a water gel-cream moisturizer, a vitamin C eye cream, a mango lip balm, and a vitamin C pineapple nectar, Cavallari’s holy grail.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The Pineapple Peptide Nectar is my favorite because it's the best for anti-aging but is also super hydrating,” she says of the gel-serum hybrid. “This is a unique and cool product because it’s a mix of vitamin C, specifically Australian Kakadu plum, which is the world’s highest source of vitamin C, and peptides in one formula. Plus, it smells so yummy. I put it on first thing in the morning.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In Cavallari’s 2019 <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/a27018454/kristin-cavallari-skincare-routine/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Go to Bed With Me" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Go to Bed With Me</a> video for BAZAAR, she confessed that she doesn't wash her face when she wakes up. “I I just splash my face of water in the morning,” she elaborates. “But at night, when I really get in there and get everything off, I love this powder-to-foam cleanser because it cleans my face so well without over drying it."</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Kristin Cavallari's Nighttime Skincare Routine | Go To Bed With Me" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/kristin-thumbnail-1-1553879711.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The entrepreneur says that her beauty philosophy is giving your skin the right nutrients—a lesson that her mother instilled in her at a young age.“My mom always told me that you’re never too young to start caring for your skin and that includes eating good food and drinking tons of water,” says Cavallari. “Beauty starts from within.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For that same reason, Cavallari says she has never had any Botox or filler. “Since I was 22 years old, I've been asked if I’ve had Botox,” she explains. “I think lines on your face are okay and I like that my face moves and I have expression. I’m 34 and I'm proud of that. Maybe when I'm 64 I might be singing a different tune. But I think we all need to embrace aging a little bit more.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Uncommon Beauty launches on May 13, 2021 on UncommonBeauty.com.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqyjmaN6pK3Rnmaaa2VugXOFkm1mpKqZqMGquoycmK%2BZnKGus7WMrqWcp52ivK95wZ6YrqypYravwMSrraKdp2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
