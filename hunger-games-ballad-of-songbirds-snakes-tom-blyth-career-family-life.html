The son of Charlotte and Gavin Blyth, Tom's father was a celebrated TV producer and journalist, famed for being a series producer on Emmerdale, while his mother is a careers counsellor.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/da1f1afc9ae2-tom-blyth-red-carpet.jpg><p id=enkCwitatt data-wc=65>In 2010, when Tom was just 15, the star sadly lost his father to cancer. Having played a pivotal role in his life, Tom credits Gavin as a major inspiration. Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>W Magazine</a>, he explained: "Through watching him work, I realised it was actually possible to make a job out of these interests. And that [entertainment] is a viable way to make a living."</p><p id=ef7wvBIIp9A data-wc=40>Echoing this sentiment in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Times</a>, Tom said: "My dad would come home from work, pour himself a glass of wine and write down notes on a script. I realised at 14 that it could be done."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=e5M-9fTEDmb data-wc=41>While very little is known about Tom's siblings, The Guardian reports that he has a sister, Anya, and a half-brother, Carter.

Speaking to PA at the UK premiere of The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbird and Snakes, he said: "It was a pretty hefty casting process. I was still pretty new on the scene, especially in the States, so they had to kind of put me through the wringer to find out if I could do it. I'm just glad that they thought I could."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fe45c0e82752-songbirdsandsnakes5.jpg><p id=eQSkgdHm0pNn data-wc=45>Having watched the original Hunger Games films, Tom was already taken with Donald Sutherland's portrayal of the character. "I don't like to say this because I play him, but Donald Sutherland was truly one of my favourite characters in the original films," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>W</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKlqnVZi_6E9 data-wc=38>While Tom has great admiration for Donald, he decided that talking to the iconic actor would only result in a "copycat" performance, so instead, he worked on creating his own, individual portrayal, with very subtle nods to Donald's.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uZ3BuZ218qcHNoJyrZZeWuqa%2FjJuYpaSRmXqwsoyspqefkp6%2Fpb%2BMrKWao5WoerW7zGaZpbGknXqkrdGenKtllpa6qrjYZqOinpVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
