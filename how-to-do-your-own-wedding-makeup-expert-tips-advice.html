You could go to a makeup counter for a lesson from a makeup artist in the lead up to your wedding, watch video tutorials, and take the time to get yourself familiar with the look you want to recreate for the big day.</p><p id=expUUfYsXfdG data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>Charlotte Tilbury reveals how to get dewy, glowing skin on your wedding day</a></strong></p><p id=eEIqvstFa4-h data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Wedding-worthy face masks you need to see</a></strong></p><h2>Invest in your makeup kit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4a7a2411cafa-makeup-kit-z.jpg><p id=e9rnToliVPNr data-wc=96>If you’re not spending the money on a makeup artist, you should be able to invest in a few key products for your on-the-day kit. Better still, you’ll be able to keep using them for other occasions after your big day is over, including your honeymoon. Key pieces to purchase are a primer, foundation that has been matched to your skin tone, powder and a waterproof mascara, for any tears on the day. Something like the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Ultimate Bridal Beauty Box</a>, created with beauty guru Hannah Martin will ensure you have everything you need to look flawless on the day.</p><h2>Create the right environment</h2><p id=eJjjsrniEaME data-wc=69>Your wedding morning is likely to be quite busy, but a chaotic environment won’t help when you’re trying to focus on getting a flawless base or gorgeous winged eyeliner. Lauren says: "Creating the right environment is key, playing your favourite calming music, having natural lighting, laying your product out in order of use and most importantly, giving yourself a good couple of hours to get ready without any interferences."</p><h2>Prep your skin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/946bdabaa0f8-poppy-delevingne-wedding-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eyspOVLgQ-ss data-wc=15><strong>Charlotte Tilbury uses Magic Cream on all her clients - including celebrity bride Poppy Delevingne</strong></p><p id=eT53oEYhkZ5k data-wc=54>You’ll want your makeup to last all day and night, so prepping your skin beforehand is key. Celebrity makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury recommends her Magic Cream, which she tells HELLO! is "magic skin and I never do makeup without it. It is the key to creating the perfect, flawless-looking, glowing goddess canvas before makeup."</p><p id=eONPQNLn6MW9 data-wc=61>Meanwhile, MAC Global Senior Artist, Claire Mulleady, recommends using primers specifically targeted for different areas of the face. "The MAC Prep + Prime range will be your best friend for ensuring all your makeup stays in place. Choose primers for your skin, lips, lashes and I always use 24 Hour Extend Eye Base to ensure your eyeshadow doesn’t crease,"&nbsp;she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8075b6376a8a-mac-eyeshadow-primer-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eX02lIihbj4u data-wc=9><strong>SHOP: MAC Prep + Prime 24-hour eye base, £16.50, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>LookFantastic</a></strong></p><h6 style=text-align:center><a aria-label="MAC Prep and Prime eye base" class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>BUY NOW</a></h6><p id=e8FfcNvDYXrA data-wc=45>Whether it's pre-wedding nerves or pure excitement, sleepless nights are almost guaranteed in the lead up to your nuptials. Ensure you hydrate your eye area sufficiently to create the perfect base for your make-up. <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">L'Occitane Immortelle Reset Eyes</a></span> is a unique serum, which is both rich and yet lightweight.</p><h2>How to apply foundation</h2><p id=efY6zrFIlk2l data-wc=92>It’s not only important to have a foundation that has been matched to your skin tone, but also to apply it correctly for the perfect base. Jane Richardson, the Global Artistry Director for NARS, says: "I always recommend applying foundation in sections as this allows you to ensure perfect blending before moving on to another area. Apply a small amount (less is more for a natural finish) between your brows and using your fingertips, massage into the skin using a circular motion to move the foundation up and out towards the hairline.</p><p id=e7kwoQSAPhoS data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Bridal beauty secrets from Kate, Meghan and Eugenie</a></strong></p><p id=epMPXX_uZFyA data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Clever ways to celebrate your would-be wedding date in lockdown</a></strong></p><p id=eKnekUm5_0fQ data-wc=101>"By applying a small amount between the brows (and not in the middle of the forehead as I often see) you will avoid any foundation visibly sitting in the hairline. Use your fingers now to push/rock the foundation into the skin before moving on to the next section – nose, under eye, cheek, chin – this motion, along with the warmth of your fingers will allow the foundation to settle further into the skin and under any baby fine hairs to look natural, not heavy." Her foundation of choice? The Sheer Glow Foundation, which costs £33.50 and has a buildable formula.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1a017d67d880-nars-sheer-glow-foundation-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=emX2GcnzLlar data-wc=7><strong>SHOP: NARS Sheer Glow Foundation, from £31, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>LookFantastic</a></strong></p><h6 style=text-align:center><a aria-label="Nars Sheer Glow Foundation" class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>BUY NOW</a></h6><h2>Don’t wear too little makeup</h2><p id=ebq7Txm7FCuM data-wc=58>Of course, on your wedding day you’ll want to look like yourself at your best, but you may need to amp up your makeup routine compared to normal. Bobbi Brown Senior PRO artist, Amy Conway, says: "Always remember against a white or ivory dress, add a touch more blush than normal to avoid looking washed out in photos."</p><p id=eJvV6-HLsgpW data-wc=1><strong>SEE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The celebs (and royals) who married during the pandemic</a></strong></p><h2>But don’t stray too far from your usual routine</h2><p id=eiqak7qgQjhO data-wc=67>That being said, you don’t want to go too overboard so that you don’t end up looking or feeling like yourself. Benefit’s Lauren Hogsden says: "When applying your own wedding makeup for your big day, you want to feel and look your very best. It’s important to not steer away too much from your usual makeup routine so you can be the perfect polished version of yourself."</p><h2>Layer your mascara</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/22f407060bc3-woman-applying-mascara-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eumcUF6pYGPP data-wc=6><strong>Layer waterproof mascara over another mascara</strong></p><p id=eglmFED3kGXF data-wc=108>Weddings can be emotional, so wearing a waterproof mascara is a no-brainer. However, layering this over another product can help to give your lashes more volume. Bobbi Brown Senior PRO artist Amy Conway says: "Always layer your mascaras! A waterproof mascara is a must on your wedding day, but first apply a mascara that isn't waterproof as a base because these give all the fullness, volume, length and curl that a waterproof can't. They layer your waterproof mascara on top to act as a raincoat to your mascara and have the best of both worlds! My favourite combo has to be Smokey Eye Mascara & No Smudge Mascara."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8fb9c1361b30-bobbi-brown-smokey-eye-mascara-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ebNG3iu-gvSp data-wc=7><strong>SHOP: Bobbi Brown Smokey Eye mascara, £25, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>John Lewis</a></strong></p><h6 style=text-align:center><a aria-label="Bobbi Brown smokey eye makeup" class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>BUY NOW</a></h6><p id=eWayFU9cz3om data-wc=1><strong>STORY: <a class=hm-link href=#>The one makeup item Princess Eugenie DIDN'T wear on her wedding day</a></strong></p><h2>Set your skin with powder</h2><p id=ekeY5ooZHFfQ data-wc=82>Help your makeup to go the distance by setting your skin with powder. Jane Richardson, the Global Artistry Director for NARS, shared her top tips with HELLO!, saying: "I&nbsp; use powder in areas where there is any potential oil production, and where any blush will be applied for a better blend using a powder puff. I use a rock and roll motion to push it into the skin to ensure it binds with the other products to look as natural as possible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ef7ff72d51d4-nars-loose-powder-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eIY7pNO2-dB7 data-wc=7><strong>SHOP: NARS Soft Velvet Loose Powder, £29, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>John Lewis</a></strong></p><h6 style=text-align:center><a aria-label="Nars loose setting powder" class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>BUY NOW</a></h6><p id=e7-ZiOrxHbSV data-wc=75>"The more that you push the powder using this technique, the better the powder will look on the skin, and the longer it will last between touch ups. Once done, use a powder brush to remove any excess and buff the skin. Remember that it takes at least 45 minutes for the complexion products to warm into the skin and look their best (NARS loose powders are all photochromic so perfect for those all-important photographs!)."</p><h2>Don’t forget your lips</h2><p id=eivYxjxXDBKG data-wc=97>Amal Clooney and Poppy Delevingne’s wedding makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury says: "On your wedding day, you should have the most beautiful lips of your life! From the magical first kiss as husband and wife, to sipping champagne and talking all day to your loved ones, a long-lasting, pout-perfecting, sumptuous lipstick is a bride’s must-have!

MAC Global Senior Artist, Claire Mulleady, says: "As you’ll be having lots of pictures taken throughout the day, carry (or get your bridesmaid to carry) Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation to mattify and give an extra flawless finish long into the night. Just use a little bit when and where it’s needed and you’ll be instantly photo-ready again."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1f00ee502950-bobbi-brown-skin-foundation-stick-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e0ZgFxL2zq8s data-wc=7><strong>SHOP: Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation stick, £32, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>LookFantastic</a></strong></p><h6 style=text-align:center><a aria-label="Bobbi Brown skin foundation stick" class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>BUY NOW</a></h6><p id=eOSwwnVBHeJe data-wc=46>Meanwhile, Bobbi Brown’s Amy Conway’s must haves are "Skin Foundation Stick, Sheer Finish Pressed Powder and a good lippy!
