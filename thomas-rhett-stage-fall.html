The singer took a tumble mid-song as he leaned over the edge of the stage while singing to shake fans' hands. Impressively, Rhett didn't miss a beat and continued singing the song from the crowd.</p><p>One fan caught the fall on video and called it "the highlight of the show."</p><p>News of stage falls travels fast in the country community, as even <a href=#>Reba McEntire&nbsp;</a>reached out on Twitter over the weekend expressing her initial concern for Rhett.</p><p>Rhett <a href=#>recently made history </a>when his ballad “Die a Happy Man” broke a record and took the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Country Airplay chart for the sixth week in a row, something that has not been done since <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> with “Our Song” in 2008.</p><p>“I seriously can’t believe this song has spent six weeks at number one,” Rhett says in a press release. “When you put a song out there as personal as this, you hope it connects and resonates with people. But I could never have imagined it would connect like this! And to mirror an achievement not seen since Taylor Swift — someone I really respect as a songwriter, performer and entertainer — is just mind-blowing.”</p><p><strong>10 Biggest Oops!
