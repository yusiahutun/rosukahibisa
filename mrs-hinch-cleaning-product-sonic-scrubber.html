Although she often tries out new tools on social media, there's one that has stuck by her through thick and thin: <span><a aria-label=sonicscrubber class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">the SonicScrubber</a></span>. The influencer, aka Sophie Hinchliffe, uses the tool to clean everything from her washing machine to her kitchen sides, and it really does work like a dream.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKWOIubgGsk9 data-wc=56>The brush is battery-powered with a non-slip handle and a long head that means it can reach into all of the places that are usually neglected (think tile grout and the back of sink pipes). Once on, the oscillating head rotates 10,000 times per minute, making for a lot less work than your usual scrubbing methods.</p><p id=eIUBz20PC3uW data-wc=49>It also comes with four different heads to tend to all of your household needs. This includes a cone head for corners, joins and tight gaps, a soft brush for delicate surfaces and upholstery, a large brush for big surface areas and powerful scrubbing, and the all-rounder medium brush.&nbsp;</p><p id=ePZsILXuU1 data-wc=36>Of course, you'll want to team it with a detergent of some kind. When Mrs Hinch demonstrated how she cleans her washing machine drawer, she used a combination of <span><a aria-label="bicarbonate of soda" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">bicarbonate of soda</a></span> and <span><a aria-label="white vinegar spray" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">white vinegar spray</a></span>.</p><p id=ecjAYbzu7D3l data-wc=49>After leaving her drawer to soak in Flash bathroom spray, she said: "I pop in a scoop of bicarb and spray white vinegar in the drawer then get my sonic out." The finished product proved that the two worked to produce a drawer that looked as good as new.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6061feb16e51-sonic-srubber-washing-machine.jpg><p id=ezi6Uc55sJPK data-wc=65>She's also demonstrated on Instagram how she uses the tool to help get her windows sparkling clean. Firstly she sprayed <span><a aria-label="Elbow grease" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Elbow Grease</a></span> on the window frames, then she used the SonicScrubber to get rid of dirt and grime before wiping it away with a cloth. Finally, she sprayed <span><a aria-label="Astonish Window" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Astonish Window Cleaner</a></span> on the glass, wiped it down and finished with a mist of <span><a aria-label="Dettol spray" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Dettol</a></span> spray.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/280949fc0063-sonic-scrubber-windows.jpg><p id=eHz4ZN4PeNMP data-wc=38>As it stands, the SonicScrubber has over 22,000 five-star reviews on Amazon testifying how powerful, effective and easy to use it is. Mrs Hinch, meanwhile, has been championing it for longer than we've been able to keep count.&nbsp;</p><p id=ew1Yd2Ae84id data-wc=24>Our verdict? If Mrs Hinch's immaculate home and the thousands of verified customer reviews are anything to go by, it's definitely worth the investment.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbyusdJoaWlqYGWEc4OYbWlwbV%2Biv7R5x6KlnKBdmLmmrc2ipaBloKe8pcHCrWSsp56esG6%2Fwqusm5qVp3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
